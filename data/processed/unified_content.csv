I was in the middle of breakdance fighting everybody or just myself. This one allows you to visually see not you as a facilitator, but the group gets to see exactly where the rest of the group stands in any given scenario by putting them in one place or another. Usually time boxing is a really good way to do this. So you say, hey, I'm going to give you a prompt. I'm only going to give you 20 seconds, 17 seconds, maybe I might even give you 13 seconds. Like not enough time to truly think through the response. After I'm done with this prompt, you're either going to be on that wall or this wall or that corner. In this corner you can set up stations wherever you want. It doesn't have to be one or the other, it can be several. And in these 13 seconds, I need you to be standing where you most relate to in this environment. Right. And you can get those pulses from everybody beforehand. What are the categories we care most about right now and put them up? Or you can just actively listen to what's going on. Pick those as a facilitator and then have everybody do that. You give them the prompt, you give them the time and then they go. You could have a neutral ground and you say something to the effect of, hey, right here is neutral. You can't decide. The problem with neutral is if you pick neutral, you are allowing me to call on you to get your exact opinion after this is over. And now you're putting them on the spot. Most people don't like to be put on the spot, so very few people will pick the neutral ground and then be careful. If somebody picks the neutral ground that likes to talk a lot, make sure that you let them know. Hey, I'm going to get your opinion really quick. 10 seconds or less. Why are you neutral and why didn't you pick these others? They might need to go to 15, 20 seconds, but it should be enough time for them to go. Don't have enough information? That's too many resources. I'm here because I'm kind of torn between these two. Something to the effect of that. So tell everybody where it is. Make those to directions clear, make the time box very short so that everyone's not looking around and going, where's Johnny going? Because I want to go where he's going. And then they go and vote. Wherever Johnny is, this one makes it very easy because you're able to go, depending on how large of a crowd you have, you're able to go, everybody, every group, count up your numbers. And then you go, how many you have?
How many do you have? How many do you have? I do this because I don't like to count any kind of numbers in front of an audience because I will inevitably mess it up. And public math and I don't work very well together. So I have them tell me, get the numbers. And I go, okay, well, you guys have it. You win. But I'd like to hear from the audience, why do you think we shouldn't do that? And then I make sure those people aren't talking, the ones that won, the one that had the majority of people on their corner or side. Why do the losers, so to speak, think that that should not be the case? And then I go, in three minutes, I want to hear. Just throw them out randomly. Let's hear it.

Impact over Easy,Easy,"3-10 participants per group, as
many groups as needed.","Concepts from a previous brainstorming activity, a
flipchart with the Impact Effort Matrix drawn, dot

not so much. This tool provides a simple matrix to allow
for the rapid voting and ranking of opportunities based
on two simple factors: How much impact will this concept
have? How easy is it to get done?",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732382/lectures/39187663 ,"Before: Developing action items After: Brainstorming concepts (problems,
stakeholders, or solutions).","Impact over easy. Exactly what you need in order to prioritize your ideas. It can be used for problems. I prefer to use it on ideas exclusively. What you'll need is a flip chart, a stack full of ideas. Your participants who hopefully created those ideas. It's best done with, well, it can be an unlimited number because you are going to need voting. You're going to need dots, which John will bring me some dots momentarily. So, to get this started, we're actually just going to draw out a simple grid. We're going to have impact on one side and we're going to have ease on the other. As you can see, higher up, meaning the more votes for the idea with our blue sticky, I mean our blue dot sticker, sticker, sticky and sticker. Our blue dot sticker will increase the impact in the red. The more dots of red we have on an idea, the more easy, the easier it will be to complete that idea. So, as you can see, I have a handful of ideas here below on this chart. Our goal is actually just to map out which ideas are both impactful and easy to be completed. This is the sweet spot area. That's where our best ideas will be located. Simple enough. So what you do is draw this map, show all the ideas to make sure all the individuals understand what ideas are available to vote on. Everyone. All individuals can vote on any ideas. I like to give, depending on the number of participants, three to five votes to each individual of each color. That's three to five blue and three to five red. Make sure that's the same exact number for both. So if we were to have, say, make an online course, that could be impactful. But it is not easy. Trust me, I'm doing it right now. Or we could get matching tattoos. That would be easy, maybe. No, it would probably be hard to convince John and it wouldn't be impactful. So that's probably going to be our lowest idea. We could host a meetup that would be relatively easy but not so impactful. We could write a book that's pretty difficult and maybe a little less impactful depending on how well we write it. Or we could do a podcast, which I'd say similar impact, similar ease. In fact, I think it's probably even easier. So when we look at that, we're not completely sold on the top right quadrant is our go to quadrant for what options are the best. So we maybe need to think about according to our business goals, according to this project's goals, which ideal would bring us the most value to tackle first? Even if it's a little difficult, even if it's a little complex. Again, each of these will have votes on them to make it as easy as possible. Blue being impact or value, blue value, kind of easy to remember and ease being red.
An individual can vote, must vote with all their ideas. They must not share what they're voting on, and they can't trade actual dots or stickers so that one person doesn't influence at all. I like to have a rule of thumb that no individual can vote for more than three of a single color on a single post it. In order to explain that it's best to actually show a post it, which I don't have right here. Show a post it with the dots on it so that they'll know where their limits are. You can also keep an eye on everyone, just to make sure no one's trying to skew the vote in one direction or another. So the process is as follows. Get the ideas. Place them in an open space where you're easily able to move them around. Ask everyone to vote next to
the idea. Vote directly next to the idea, not on top of it. If you have a large group of individuals, there can be so many votes on an idea that you can't even read it. This allows you to easily count them and then take that exact post it and move it over to our prioritization grid. I found best practices. You allow the voting of the two different colors and then you write down. So for impact, 14 votes. For ease, we've got seven. So you have that for each idea, and then that makes it easier to actually line out. Some people might be very specific, like John, and need to have the exact measurements laid out so that it's easy to move the ideas in a grid form. This is just a simple, quick way to organize your ideas. Now, if you want to go an extra step, you can always divide up the ideas into, you know, your best bet, which I have terrible handwriting. Your best bet, your, you know, let's get it done soon, or keep focused on it. I like to think of this as the research category. How could we make it easier to do? How could we make it more impactful? And then probably your no go zone. So down here is your no go zone. It doesn't have impact. It's not really going to do anything good for us. So we'll leave those ideas to decide. We might need to research a little bit more, and since it's easiest, we could just pop in and do that one right away. Now, this is called many names the Eisenhower matrix, the impact effort grid, the prioritization grid. You can host it, you can go through it however you like. This is just the steps that I prefer to take so that it is as direct, straightforward and simple as possible. The two colored dots allow for a greater depth of understanding about what we're prioritizing. A lot of times people can get caught up on impact. What does impact mean? So impact just means value to the organization and value to the user. When we say easy, that's the how easy is it going to be for us to get the resources we need to get to the due date on time, to have everything at our fingertips so that we can actually complete the idea? So impact versus ease, that is impact over easy.

In this prioritization exercise, ideas will be compared and

to note: the facilitator plays a major role in guiding the
session smoothly. Line up your ideas, and get ready to
fight! Please don’t fight.",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732382/lectures/39187665 ,Before: Defining a path forward. After: Generating concepts or ideas.,"Now, if you were ever in middle school in America, you probably played the basketball game knockout where you line up on the free throw line. You have to shoot. The person behind you is shooting as fast as they can behind you. Sorry, I'm left handed. I'll do it right handed too. They're shooting as fast as they can behind you to try and knock you out of the game. In this prioritization exercise, the great, great advantage of it is that you will have a head to head between every idea that you have come up with. So I like to limit the pool of ideas to about eight. Otherwise it can be rather overwhelming. For this exercise, you just need your eight ideas or less ideas, a space to put them. It could be on the wall or it could be on flat on a table, and you line them up in one straight line like shown here. As you go through this, you can do it picking one single individual or asking the entire group. I prefer to ask the entire group. So we'll walk through it. You have all your ideas lined up in a single line on a flat surface. The order at this moment actually doesn't matter, but once we've gone through all the ideas, we will leave with a prioritized list of every idea versus every idea to show one true winner, one champion in the far square, which will be on the far left of whatever flat surface you have. So here are the rules, and I'm going to show you because it can get a little confusing. We'll start off with a head to head of concepts versus idea. When you start off, you're always going to want to start with the first idea on the right. We do that because as we progress through each idea, we'll know that this idea has already been used. So the unused idea on the right is the one we're going to start with. Are you confused yet? I'll keep going. So we'll start with concepts. Concepts will be in a head to head battle with idea. Now, crowd participants, is this idea more important than this concept? Yes or no? Let's discuss it. We'll have 1 minute to make a decision. Who would win in this head to head battle of importance of this idea? Well, it looks like concepts was not a winner. So concepts will stay to the right of the idea. It went head to head with an idea, will then be able to continue on forward. Now, the more ideas you have, the more overwhelming it can get. So I'm going to add a few more ideas so we can kind of walk through what a full round might look like. So concepts lost. We're going to restart the knockout rounds with the next idea in line from the right, which is idea. We're going to drop it below thought. Now, is this or this one more important? Well, it turns out ideas more important.
So, thought we'll go to the right. Idea will then move to left to battle the next idea. So is jacket or idea more important? Ah, looks like jacket's more important in this case. So we'll repeat that process of picking up an idea from the right that has not been discussed yet, battling all the way to the left until they lose, and then returning back to the next idea on the right that hasn't been used. So we'll continuously come back to the beginning. Have we used concepts? Yes. Have we used thought? Yes. Have we used idea? Yes. Which means this would be our final prioritization of jacket, idea, thought, and concepts. This allows you to go through every idea and know, as opposed to voting on a broad number of ideas. This is sort
of voting on just two ideas in a way. It's isolated voting on everything but super focused so that you are able to think of all the factors between what this thought brings to the table and what this concept brings to the table. Now, it does take more time because you're having more conversations watching it in action. It's very simple. One straight line of post its, one idea battling another. If it loses, it stays where it's at. If it wins, it continues progressing forward. This can take between 30 minutes all the way up to over an hour, depending on how many ideas and how in depth the conversations of those head to head knockout rounds go. It's full of conversation. It can get a little heavy if you let it go for longer than 30 minutes. I try and keep the number of participants to under seven just because the number of opinions can become overwhelming in the number of responses so long that you for sure will be in that conference room, that workshop space, for over an hour. That's knockout, and it can definitely hit all the ideas out of the way and leave you with a perfect prioritized list to turn into action items.",voting tools,['A head-to-head battle between every idea (top 8 ideas)'],,

Applause as a way of voting is not a perfect science because some people are going to be super loud, some people are not. So this is when things don't exactly have to matter, right? So I'll give you a couple examples. Hey, do you want to push through and do a working lunch and leave home early or leave here early or do you want to stop, take a break, have an extended lunch, et cetera, get to know each other? We're going to do applause and I'm going to use the sound meter that's in my back pocket and based on how loud this gets is what we're going to do. So who wants to go to lunch early? Let's hear it. Round of applause. You have 3 seconds to make as much noise as you want. Ready, set, go. Then you do the other. Ready, set, go. Somewhat awkward if nobody yells, so you got to know your environment for this as well. But applause or snaps or yelling or animal noises, whatever you choose. This type of voting kind of gets a consensus very quickly. You can kind of understand if one person is making all the noise, but when everybody in the room is doing something, you know you're moving towards the right direction.

Non verbal voting, one of the easiest ways to prevent a whole bunch of people getting into an argument on what they agree on or what they disagree on, that there is. It entails kind of like the Caesar up or down thumb, and it happens at the exact same time so that people don't take other people's votes. Typically what will happen is if you're in the room with the manager or somebody that oversees you in some kind of way, shape or form, you wait to see what their vote is and then you kind of potentially vote. So if you don't really know where you're at and you see Johnny vote for something in the upwards way direction, you're going to give it the affirmative as well, because you're like, I don't really know, and then you do it. So nonverbal voting, you're going to prep the audience by saying, hey, listen, we're about to do some non verbal voting. That means no talking, please. And there's no talking for a reason. That reason is to prevent your ideas from jumping in the heads of other people before they vote. So nonverbal voting, you're going to hold your thumb out and vote in the upwards or downwards direction. Up means this and the ramifications are. Down means this, and the ramifications are you let them know exactly what's going on so that when everybody votes, they're ready to go and you're going to say, I'm going to count down, I'm going to go, three, two, one, vote. When I say vote, your hand has to be out. You need to be voting. And please don't wait to vote, or else your vote doesn't count. You know, you could do some like, hey, this is like cupcake wars. If the cupcakes is not out of the oven, it doesn't count. If your vote's not out, it doesn't count. Okay. Or you awkwardly put somebody on the spot and you say you didn't vote on time, what's your vote? I don't recommend doing that unless you know the individual or have had some kind of experience with them to see how they're going to act or react to that kind of prompt. But in the end, you're going to do quick math. Most people are not good at public math, including myself, very good at math, when nobody's watching, but nobody knows that because nobody actually is around me when I'm doing that math in public. If you look around and the overwhelming majority of people have their thumbs up or down, you know what to do. If it's split down the middle, take the time to count it. Go around and count every single one. And what you can do as a facilitator, you don't have to tell everybody what the votes are. You can say, okay, keep your votes visible and you just go around and you do this in your head and you count them out. You know how many people you have? You know how many you vote just counted. And if it teeters over the middle number, that's what you go with. Okay. Nonverbal voting. Nobody has to write anything down. You don't have to waste anything. And it's super quick once everybody does this one time and you establish the ground rules for what you want at any given time, you can ask for a vote after that in a group setting and you're going to get it right away.

Probably because they look so cute and you know exactly what they are. Ice cubes, flames, hot, cold. It says zero to 100. You can make it any degree you want. You could use a Kelvin scale if you'd like. I don't even know those numbers, but you could. Hot and cold. The idea here is a way of voting to get everybody to put their idea where they think it ranks on the hot and cold scale. Now, there's no perfect science to this because some people that really love their ideas are going to say, oh man, that's hot. I'm going to put it up here. Some people are going to go, ah, yeah, I think it's okay. And they're going to kind of move around. Not very many people are going to say, my idea is cold, but what you can do is take a range of ideas that have all been thrown into the pot and have everybody grab an idea that's not theirs and rank it really quick. There's a lot of different ways that you can do this, but in the end you're going to wind up with a 60% solution with where they rank. Now, you can time box people at the end to say no. Two stickies can land at the exact same spot. So obviously you're going to need a bigger scale, most likely a really big wall. You can use horizontal instead of vertical if you'd like. In the end, you have to go, they can't match, they can't be on the same. So move the ones that are hotter, move the ones that are colder so that they kind of space out instead of clumped all towards hot or in the middle. Like it's a spectrum, let's move it out type of thing. So hot, cold, flames, ice cubes, you can do whatever you'd like. You can use whatever scale you like. The whole purpose is to get everybody to, to think, how good is my idea? How good are the ideas around me in relation to one another without taking a ton of time to get there? Now, being able to do that allows you to have some discussions around the things that landed over here. Potentially, if they're way down here, it prevents you from having a discussion at all. We don't even need to talk about these, but maybe you allow some people that had their ideas land here to give some amplifying information that not everybody knew. Hey, oh, by the way, did you know that we could accomplish this with fewer this, fewer that, and in a faster way, blah, blah, blah. And maybe you give them an opportunity to talk to the masses.

No, these are ideas. Each one of these is its own idea. So imagine a group of five to seven people. They get together and they're trying to decide the best idea without, you know, stepping on anybody's toes. Instead of having a discussion and going through it. You can do a horse race. It's super fast. Once everybody understands how to do it, you can do it numerous times. It doesn't really get old because you can change the animal from a horse to anything. Chubby. Unicorn. Those are rhinos. Horse race. Now, this is what you do. Your idea is on the board. Everybody has an opportunity to move one, only one forward, a space. So imagine one sticky note space to the right. Ok. You can draw lines if you'd like. I left it clean so that you could use your imagination on how you want to do it. But imagine I can't move my own horse on the very first round. So there can be several rounds, but the very first round, you cannot move your own horse. So let's say we come up to this thing and Johnny moves my idea forward. I move Johnny's idea forward. Not because we have some kind of secret kind of pact or anything, but they're really good ideas. Susie moves this idea forward and then, let's say the last person, Brent, decides to move this one forward at a glance. You know, this horse is silly. It's going the wrong direction. Nobody voted for it. It was a bad idea. But you kind of cut it off. You go, hey, this one didn't even leave. Nobody thought it was good enough to proceed these move forward and then that one definitely moved forward. Right.
So by now you realize someone's going to move it once and then another person is going to go on top and move it again. That's okay. This could get all of the votes, right? So if the horse has started at the very beginning and it can't get all of them because you can't vote for your own, say the person that came up with this idea voted for this one, but the person that came up with this one moved it forward one. The person that came up with this moved it forward one. And wherever I'm at, moved it forward one. It's way out of the stable. It's already doing laps around everybody else. It's a horse race. Okay. That's the very first round of the horse race. This is where it gets interesting. The first time you could not pick your own, but now you start the horses back over of what's remaining, right? So we get rid of the idea that we didn't love. It's gone. We start the race again and we maybe give the one that had the absolute lead. Maybe we give them one extra. It's up to you, really. You could leave it the same. And now you can say you can vote for your own idea if you'd like. And you can see maybe how things have changed. Maybe Johnny votes for his own and doesn't vote for me. And maybe because I'm a nice guy, I voted for. Johnny's thinking he was going to vote for mine and he didn't, so his horse is way out there. Anyways. I've done this before, up to six rounds of a horse race to see how the horse go. You don't actually have to bring them all the way back and start over. You can keep the horses going depending on how much room you have. In the end, you visually see where the idea racks and sacks next to the others. It's also
kind of fun, especially if you choose different animals, et cetera. Remember, these are not cute little pictures of horses. Thanks, Johnny, for drawing these.

There's no shame in that, in admitting, hey, I followed this because I believe in him or her, and they've got a solid head on their shoulders. They know what they're doing. I'm willing to follow them anywhere they go, or no, I love this idea, etcetera. What you're going to find is sometimes those groups are duplicates. So you'll have one over here and one over here that are somewhat of the same idea, but it allows you to consolidate it in a very short amount of time without having to get everybody up to a wall or anything like that. Also, it's kind of like an icebreaker, where everybody just has to run around in pure and total chaos. Chaos has its place in a workshop. It can get the heart rate going. It can be used to read the room and the audience. It can be used to put people in an uncomfortable position.
Hey, let's embrace the discomfort here before we move on to the next thing, so that if you do something in the future that is also outside of their comfort zone, maybe it's not as far out as it would have been if they hadn't done this thing with you before. So this one is groupings. You do not have to make this pure and total chaos. You can follow the ones that we did before where it's like, hey, raise your hand if you want to go over here with this one. Raise your hand if you want to go over there with that one, etcetera. And methodically bring people where they need to go. This is based on your facilitation style, people in the room, and what you're attempting to get out of it. Groupings.",voting tools,[],,

After: Brainstorming potential solutions.,"Finite numbers, percentages, for lack of a better title, for this voting strategy, you can use money numbers, percentages. You can use index cards or stacks of post its. You can use pretty cool little things where everybody gets to have a certain amount of money, etcetera. In the end, you're getting to the same goal. That is, you're giving everybody a bunch of different options to choose from, as opposed to just saying, I like this one, and here's why. Instead, you're saying, let's just say there are ten different items to choose from. You've given everybody enough to discard a few, so you give everybody seven votes, okay? And you know that they can vote for the same item four times, they can vote for the second item three times, et cetera, and that's it. They get to vote for two different things, et cetera, and you get to see how it plays out. My favorite example of this is 100%. You have 100%, and you need to devote that percentage however you'd like, across the spectrum. So you can vote for. I typically don't like to let everybody vote 100% of their thing towards one item if they really, really love it, but you can choose that on your own. I try to at least make that a third or 50% of it. So they would say, okay, 50% of my votes are going towards this one item, 20% are going towards this one, so on and so forth, et cetera. If you look online of different ways to use this method, there are countless examples. So I highly recommend that you choose one that works for your personality, for the outcome, for the people in the room, etcetera. But I think one thing that you're going to find that's pretty constant is the two thirds rule. And that rule is, it's not really a rule. That method is essentially making sure that they cut a third of the things that you can vote on out of the equation. Here are the third that we don't want or need, so that they can only vote even if they decided one per category, et cetera, that they haven't been able to vote on the other. The last third, they get to vote on two thirds of it, etcetera. So you can use this with money. Although if you do use money, I highly recommend that you make the money not tangible. So people aren't looking at $20 and going, well, that's really worth more like $2,000 or whatever. Even though that sounds very obvious to you and me, when you get in that setting, you are opening yourself up for people to draw parallels in real money to real value. Instead, put your own face on dollar bills or come up with your own type of game to allow people to spread it out. That's why I like percentages. It allows you to kind of pick and choose what you want. This one's easy to do online. In the in person scenario, you have to plan this one out. You can't just come into a workshop, decide, we're going to vote based on this method, and you haven't planned it, you haven't prepped it. There's nothing to pass out. You don't know where the bins or categories are, and you're not prepared. That is a recipe for a disaster, in my opinion. So for this one, I highly recommend that going into it, you know exactly how you're going to do it, where things are going to be, what you're going to call them, so that you can pass out the dollars, maybe even in the beginning of the workshop. And this is a really cool way to kind of put suspense into your workshop. You can go, hey, those dollars, don't take them out of your pocket. Don't give them to anybody else. We'll get to those later.
And everyone's like, well, what are we going to do? We're going to play games, is this monopoly? Et cetera, et cetera. Kind of keeps everything going a little bit. So play with this one. Start small, build up. And by starting small, I mean give everybody five votes and say, you can vote for this same object no more than twice or three times, and you have x number of things to vote on, ten things to vote on and see how that feels, and then kind of build off and make it bigger and more elaborate as you go. This one, for lack of a better title, is voting by numbers as a finite number or percentage.",voting tools,[],,

We're gonna find you and take. No, I'm kidding. It's pretty, pretty bad. We can cut that out. Maybe not. So, dot voting. Everybody knows how to do it. You've probably done it before. But I'm going to demonstrate two different ways of doing dot voting that matter, depending on your personality and the people that you are leading through this workshop or meeting, etcetera, to get the best, most efficient, effective way of getting to that end solution, end goal with them. What? You're going to need dots. So the thing with these kind of dots, you can have big ones, small ones, you can have emoji looking dots. It really doesn't matter as long as everybody has the ability to vote. We like these because they have different colors, so they can mean different things. We really don't like something red, we absolutely love it. Green, this is like the best thing ever, maybe even better. Or blue, it's getting cold. Or yellow, let's have caution, whatever, right? You can come up with something that works for you, or emojis, et cetera. So you're going to have a bunch of things up here, some ideas, people are going to. Thank you, Johnny. I appreciate that. So you can have concepts and ideas and thoughts, and you'll be able to tell everybody, groups of five to seven in smaller groups or a really big board wall, et cetera, for 30 plus people, so that everybody kind of comes by and does it. So the two different ways to do it, one is anonymous, anonymous dot voting. Very, very hard to do in the moment if you haven't prepped it, so that people don't really know where they're going to go. Okay. You don't necessarily have to make it so that you don't see where everybody's at, but you give them almost no time whatsoever in order to vote. So you need enough room. That's what I meant by the prep. You need enough room where the ideas are spaced out. And then you tell everybody, hey, I'm going to give you, before you hand them this, I'm going to give you about five to ten minutes to review these, or, you know, I'm going to send you on a 15 minutes break. And during that break, I need you to spend at least five minutes on this board looking through ideas that you heard from the audience, etcetera. Okay? They come back, you hand them these and you tell them what they mean, and you say, I need you in less than 30 seconds to put these where you need to put them. Think about where you're going to put them. And when I say go, you'll do it. You wait. Give them like 30 seconds to think through it, and then you say, you only have 4 seconds to run up to the board and post your thing.
It is chaos. Hands are everywhere, etcetera. Be careful. People could get hurt or trampled. And also be careful with the proximity of individuals to each other, etcetera. They run up, they post it. It's a way of kind of like voting at the exact same time. You can't really base your idea on Johnny's because Johnny's already moved up and posted his and you don't have enough time to go over to the side and change your vote. So that's kind of the anonymous way of doing it. The other way is you basically just tell everybody to find their best. Maybe you give them three dots each and they can use those three dots however
they'd like. They can put three ideas on the exact same concept and their three dots are done, they're over with. Be careful. Don't give them a whole thing like this. Actually cut them out. So everybody has the exact same number that you're looking for, or they could, if it's a different person, they might vote one here and then two here. And depending on the number of ideas you have and the number of people, you're going to want to ramp up the number of dots that you have for the number of ideas, ramp them down for less numbers, et cetera. This can be done very, very quickly, and you can also completely anonymize it by having people go behind a wall and pass the vote to you to place them wherever you need to place them so that everybody has a visual of what everybody's looking at. It's really cool to look at a board of a ton of ideas and go, I notice a ton of red around this area. Why is that? We can have a discussion around it. I notice a ton of green around this area. Why is that? Let's dive into it. Why do we have caution over here, et cetera? It's just a way to fine tune your discussion and as a facilitator, fine tune the questions that you're going to ask everybody there and, and the prompting that you're going to need for the people that are in this workshop or meeting with you to get to a result that everybody can high five at the end or high elbow each other in agreement. Hey, we, at least we're sort of on the same page. Let's move forward as opposed to I don't want to do this, but I'm going to do it because my boss said that I had to type of thing. So this one voting. You can change this to make this your own however you'd like. You can have them draw little things. They can not use dots. They can draw an image of whatever they want and post it next to the one that they like the most. It's really up to you. Have a ball.",voting tools,[],,

research. After: Sharing ideas or concerns around a topic.","This is a way. This is a way to vote non verbally, without applause, and with a bunch of buckets. You don't need buckets. In fact, the very first few years that I did this, I did it with cardboard lying around. And in fact, you can just do it with sections of tables. You can tape off areas of a room or a corner where people throw votes in, etcetera. A vote is simply a post it note. They don't even have to write anything on that post it note. And each bin or bucket or area that you have is underneath something that you've designated. So you designate this as option a, B, C, D, etcetera. And you tell everybody what the options are. You allow them enough time to go around and truly study those. I try not to do this one super quick. I try to give everybody enough time, and I usually bake it in with a break. So I say, instead of a ten minute break, I might say, hey, you have a 13 minutes break. But when we start back, I need you to have voted on one of these things. Simply walk around, take a sticky and throw it into one of these bins. You can only use one. Now, there are some definite flaws to this one, because if somebody really wants to be malicious, they can throw a couple. I try to stay in the room to kind of make sure that everybody's being fair, etcetera. Also, you can see where other people vote. So those are the drawbacks. You can get around those by putting these buckets behind a wall, like a whiteboard or something like that. So everybody has to leave on their way out and drop something into the top of a cardboard cutout or something like that, or put something into the bin, or you're behind the wall and you're able to throw them where they want, or you collect them and. And they say, I want this for option a or b, or they point to it and you put it there anyways. The whole point is, in the end, it's the quantity of post its that matter in those categories. You count them up, they come back from break and you're able to say, hey, option b has it. We had eight out of 16, but the other ones only amounted to two or three. So same thing as the other voting applies. You lead this into a discussion unless it's absolutely overwhelming or you don't have all of the information that you need to make that decision moving forward. So you ask the people that, quote unquote, lost, why is it that you think that this should not take place? Or why should we not do this, etcetera, and allow a little bit of discussion to take place. This one is bins to buckets. Buckets are more fun. Cardboard works. It really doesn't matter. This is all about getting a consensus from the group to kind of move forward.",voting tools,[],,
Brainwriting,Medium,"5-7 participants per group, can have multiple groups",,"10-15 mins, depending on efficiency of brainstorming","A tactic for rapidly generating lots and lots of ideas by creating a time-crunch and encouraging “yes-and” thinking. “Yes-and” thinking is easy: after hearing or writing an idea, simply try to add onto that existing concept to plus it up or create something new.

Number of Participants 5 - 7 participants in agroup seated at a table.
Materials:Sheet of paper folded into equal rectangles, sharpies for each participant. Best to prep an example pre-workshop.
What is it? A pressure cooker of an ideation process, this exercise consists of timeboxed windows of
brainstorming and rapid collaboration. Participants will create an initial idea before chaos creates diamonds.
Using the concepts of others and the pressure of time, participants will generate 8 fresh concepts in less than 8 minutes. Filter-free innovation!",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732284/lectures/39185862,," Brainwriting is a supercharged, super energetic, sort of energy demanding brainstorming exercise to create as many ideas as possible in a time boxed window. So, here is what you need. All your participants are going to need is a sheet of a one standard white paper and they're going to need something to write with.
I prefer sharpies. Pens are hard to see and kind of confuse people. So I'm going to recommend a Sharpie. In order to do this exercise, you need everybody to fold their paper once in half. I think that's called hamburger.
And then repeat that, folding it in half again so that you have a double folded. I'm going to show that one more time. So we folded it in half, I folded that half long ways in half again and then I'm going to stand it up tall and make eight equal rectangles is the goal of all this folding eight equal rectangles.
Now, in order to do this exercise, you need to all be seated around a table. It doesn't have to be circular, but you have to be a continuous grouping of people so that you are able to pass your idea to the left.
Each participant is able to pass their idea to their left continuously around in a circle. So that where we begin is where we end, meaning the idea we actually write is the last idea needed to fill the entire page.
All right, so now that you're extreme, mainly confused, let me show you how it's done. So Brainwriting consists of folding your paper into equal parts and then having that paper. I've done the numbers just for you all but starting with one, the first participant, the first individual, everyone will do this at the same time.
Every individual will fold their paper and then write their favorite idea that they've had for the day in the top corner. Okay, next, after they finish writing their idea, the clock starts. They pass their idea to the participant to their left.
That participant must read their idea and then build upon it in 1 minute. So they will have to bust it up or create a new idea inspired by that original idea. The cycle will continue of passing the idea to the left after a minute.
As facilitator, you will be in charge of time. You will have to make people panic so that they stay on the clock. Time boxing brainstorming forces you to create a greater quantity of ideas in a smaller amount of time.
It also forces you to throw logic out of the window as much of the time. You don't have the ability to think through all the shortcomings of your idea before getting it out there. Now remember the original idea which each participant will write down in the top corner of their paper.
Their rectangles must be plused up. So here's an example. The original idea is an app that prioritizes an individual's task for work. Now we passed it to the left and after 1 minute this is the idea that was on.
There a push notification of what task and when. So now it's not just an app, it's a push notification of what you need to do right before you need to do it. And it to the next individual we can see in the third idea.
It's an auto adjust if I skip a task. So maybe I don't want to do that task right now. Just not in the mood for it, don't have the resources or the energy to do it. Moves on to the next one. So to set the stage, you will be seated at a table.
With the participants or you as the facilitator can remain standing and not a part of the group. Everyone is in a circle or in a continuous shape, one page per participant. Everyone will write down their idea in the top corner of their page and then pass it to their left.
So everyone should have, after round one, just a page with one idea ready for them to add their own, plusing up the original idea or creating a new concept with a little bit of flavor from that original idea.
Now, while it sounds like a complex process, in reality it's very simple. Write your idea down, pass it to the left, continue until the page is complete. Now, if you have more than eight participants, that means the idea won't go all the way around the entire group.
I like to have this done with five to six participants. Although it doesn't allow us to fill in the whole page, it does get a lot of
energy going, it does generate a lot of ideas. What you will notice is around the third or fourth round, the ideas will become
Powered by Notta.ai
 
 so abstract that many of them aren't so useful.
But because we have such quantity, although many aren't useful, a handful might be. And just having those one or two really crazy, really incredible ideas is what we're looking for. We're kind of forcing people to dig through and forcing them out of that comfort zone which they normally will stay in during Brainstorming.
I have tried to do this three rounds, totally burned out everyone. I would recommend, if you are going to brainwriting only do it two rounds maximum, meaning two all the way times through of eight, filling in the entire rectangle, or else you'll lose the attention and energy of your participants for the remainder of your workshop.
So, since this is time boxed, you know how long it's. Per sheet. I've noticed about ten minutes is enough time to go through. As the participants get more and more used to creating ideas quickly, that minute can shrink down all the way to 30 seconds.
After several times going through the ideas, maybe on the third or fourth time, they have to write down a new idea on a new sheet of paper. What I like to do is just start decreasing the time, because I notice everyone is able to get their ideas out a lot faster.
So, Brainwriting, although it seems complex, is incredibly simple. Fold your page, get eight equal rectangles, write your idea in the top right hand corner of the page is a simple way to do it, and then go from there.
You can do it on the left, you could do it on the bottom left, whichever flows the best. Pass that single idea to your left, and then the timer starts for a 1 minute round, repeating every minute as the page passes across the room.
It's super energizing, it's super intense, and you get some incredible results from a very small time window. And that, my friends, is Brainwriting.",brainstorming,"['A pressure cooker of an ideation process, this exercise consists of timeboxed windows of\nbrainstorming and rapid collaboration']",tools,beginner

Medici. Mama mia. That accent was terrible to get your attention, because this next exercise is all about generating ideas. Now, we call it the Medici method. I like to think it's because the Medici family from Florence took inspiration from a lot of places.
We're going to take inspiration from a lot of different companies that exist in the world today or in the past. So here's the setup. It's pretty simple. You write companies, cool thing, and crazy idea.
And before I dive all the way in, five to seven participants is my rule of thumb per chart. You can have multiple charts across the room. I just like to keep my group small so that the conversations are more in depth.
The setup again, companies cool thing, crazy idea. What I like to do is get the entire room full of participants listening all at once. And I ask the group, can you tell me, what are some of the most innovative companies in the world?
And they might say apple. They might say Facebook or Google. I can guarantee you that. They'll always say Tesla. So we say, okay, Tesla. Now, tell me, what's the cool thing about that company? What makes them unique?
And they might say something like, they push the limits on technology. And they think, that's amazing. That's so innovative that they're always trying to figure out the next thing, just going farther and farther.
All right, what I like to do is go through maybe five, six different companies, and the cool thing, the value that makes them unique. Now, tech pushing the limits. You can ask them to be a little more specific.
Really? Why are they so innovative? What makes you think they're so innovative? Write that down. Capture it. Put it on a chart where everyone can see. Send the individuals back to their groups. Sit them down.
Say you have. Four minutes to come up with as many crazy ideas thinking about the problem as if you were this company with this cool thing about you. So if we were thinking about me, I always forget to clean my knife.
The peanut butter. I love peanut butter sandwiches. I can never get the peanut butter off the knife. Huge problem. So if I was Tesla and I was pushing technology to the limits, and I know we have some self driving technology, well, maybe we have some self cleaning technology.
Now I don't need to clean my knife ever again because by thinking like Tesla, I've been able to create a solution to my own problem. So focusing on the problem, thinking as if you were the company and adding in that cool thing will allow you to generate more and more ideas.
Now it is through a filter, so those ideas will be from their perspective, but it allows you to completely leave behind your natural train of thought. Lets you put on sort of like a little temporary mask.
And thinking through what they see, you may be able to solve your problem even better than you could on your own. This is a simple brainstorming technique to generate as many ideas as possible and encourage everyone, in fact, I would say probably demand that everyone or it forces everyone to think outside of their normal realm and generates a lot of unique ideas that you would have never seen just by straightforward brainstorming.
That's the Medici method. Again, I like to do it over the course, ten to 15 minutes from the description to the sharing of ideas. The more ideas you have, the longer you can share based on what comes out of it.
You can always prioritize the best ideas and then figure out how to make them more tangible. This is just a starting point for you to yes and or plus up your ideas. And improve anything. Any problem you're trying to tackle?

All you're going to need, bunch of index cards and a writing utensil for everybody. Okay? You can pass these out in advance so that they're sitting at everybody's table when they get there.
You can pass a survey out before everybody gets to the event. It to pre write some ideas or thoughts or questions down on some kind of prompt on each one of these and then pass them out. Okay? This is going to anonymize how we build and support each other's ideas moving forward.
It is a ton of fun. I love this one. It never gets old. For some reason, I always also like to have a playlist going so I can hit play for music. Here's how it works. Make sure everybody gets one of these.
You ask a very specific question, how are we going to solve this? Right? You could use like the how might we how might we improve upon this? Or how might we do this? How might we do that, et cetera. Okay?
You're going to have everybody take the time to answer it the first go around. I'd give everybody at least a minute, which potentially a little bit awkward. I wouldn't give any more any less than 45 seconds.
I probably wouldn't give any more than 90 seconds to answer a question like that. Boom. Go. Everybody writes it down. Then you say to everybody, all right, when I say go, your objective is to pass your card to at least five, six, seven people.
I want you to pass it to as many people as possible. The bigger number or you just calling out the most you can possibly do, the better, because people are going to go a little crazy here. You have to give this caveat before you let them loose or else you'll never get them back.
You go when I say time's up. I need you to stop, turn, look at me and wait for the next piece of instruction, okay? And then have some kind of clever way of doing it. Some people do the clap. You clap once, and then if you're around know, clap once.
If you can hear me, clap twice. A couple other people clap twice, and then so on and so forth until you get out. The whole group. You could do the Johnny and make some very weird noises. You can car or act like whatever.
You get everybody's attention. Okay, cool. Everybody's got their idea. You say go, you hit play, you're playing music. They're passing it. They're going crazy. Here's the thing. I thought the very first time I did this for a group of very senior individuals, and I don't mean age, just mean senior, right?
Tenured. I don't know the right word for that. Whatever. Important people, a lot of important people, I thought they would be a little bit duddy around this. They'd be like, oh, pass it here and pass it there, and oh, this isn't going to be very cool.
They got into it. I mean, the first time I did it told me it can be for any range of people from any kind of background. They will love this one. Something about passing an index card as many times as you can around the room to as many people is just funny.
I don't know why. It's just funny. Okay, so you get everybody's attention. You now tell them, all right, I want you to read what you have on your card. So hopefully you understand by now that if it's been passed around randomly four or five times, the odds of anybody knowing the card that they originally had, where it is and who it's from, or vice versa, the person that has the card, where it came from, et cetera, are close to zero.
Unless somebody's sitting there and watching everywhere that it goes, which they can't, because they have to pass their own card. So nobody knows where anybody's card is. It's fully anonymized, right?
And now you're going to do the next piece. You're going to tell them to read it, and if they strongly agree with it, they're going to flip it over on the back, and they're going to write a five. If they it absolutely oppose it.
They're going to put a zero. If it's okay, they'll put a one. If it's good, they'll put a two. If it's better, they'll put a three, et cetera, until you get to five. You're going to rate it zero to five.
Okay? Then you start the music again, they do it again. Then you do it again. You do it again. You do it again. And you would

You'd think that people would get really sick of passing cards and going to the next round, but they're, like, ready for it.
They can't wait for you to hit play and do it again. Again. I have no idea why. I don't know why. It just works. Okay, you get to the end, you have the last person that just went so there's five people that just went five different numbers on the back.
You have them add up the score, right? So you have a total of 25, and you have a minimum of zero. If everybody thought your idea was terrible, they're going to put a zero. You add them up, and you go.
Raise your hand if you have above ten, right? You're going to get a bunch of people to raise their hand. Raise your hand if you have above 15. Raise your hand if you have above 20. And if you have a couple cards that have above a 20.
Odds are that it is a very good idea. Either one person rated it at zero and everybody else rated a five, or everybody rated it pretty high for the most part. So what you're going to want to do is keep that going until you get two, three, four of these cards.
You grab the cards, you read from them in front of everybody, and you say, we agree. For the most part, at least five. Nine out of ten dentists recommend this one. Right? At least five people thought that this was a meaningful card, right?
So you're going to read it out loud, maybe have everybody sit down and have a meaningful discussion around what was on that card. You could if you wanted to do this a little bit differently, you could do everything that I've explained so far, but instead of rating something on the back, you plus up the idea below it.
So somebody says, One scoop of ice cream is delicious. You would write, I prefer two scoops of ice cream. That's even better. Whatever. It's a bad example, but it allows you to put your own thoughts in here and doesn't allow me to kind of steamroll you with my own.
Okay. You get them to plus up the idea every single time until it goes around. You can do that as many times as you'd like. I recommend that you don't really go more than four people because people have really bad handwriting, and some people write really big.
No matter how big your index card is, I've passed some monsters out before, and people still fill up the space no matter what you say to them. It just happens that way. So three or four people, you get to the end, and you just pulse the audience.
Hey, what card? If you're holding your card, do you think that the idea that you started with to the idea that you're currently at it is better, genuinely, for everybody? Yes. Cool. Read it. Let's hear it.
Let's talk about it. So a couple of different ways to do this. I can imagine that you might think of something that we haven't even discussed here that allows you to make this your own, truly and have a lot of fun.
Again, this is not something that looks like you're having a lot of fun and jokes, but for some reason, people passing each other, throwing cards to each other, it's just a good time. And it cuts down on the amount of discussion.
Get to get a consensus. You can do this in about with a group of 25 people you can do this in about, I'd say, seven minutes from start to end to reading, and then, obviously, your discussion after the fact can go as long as you need it to go to get to the root of what you're trying to talk about.

All you're going to need, bunch of index cards and a writing utensil for everybody. Okay? You can pass these out in advance so that they're sitting at everybody's table when they get there.
You can pass a survey out before everybody gets to the event. It to pre write some ideas or thoughts or questions down on some kind of prompt on each one of these and then pass them out. Okay? This is going to anonymize how we build and support each other's ideas moving forward.
It is a ton of fun. I love this one. It never gets old. For some reason, I always also like to have a playlist going so I can hit play for music. Here's how it works. Make sure everybody gets one of these.
You ask a very specific question, how are we going to solve this? Right? You could use like the how might we how might we improve upon this? Or how might we do this? How might we do that, et cetera. Okay?
You're going to have everybody take the time to answer it the first go around. I'd give everybody at least a minute, which potentially a little bit awkward. I wouldn't give any more any less than 45 seconds.
I probably wouldn't give any more than 90 seconds to answer a question like that. Boom. Go. Everybody writes it down. Then you say to everybody, all right, when I say go, your objective is to pass your card to at least five, six, seven people.
I want you to pass it to as many people as possible. The bigger number or you just calling out the most you can possibly do, the better, because people are going to go a little crazy here. You have to give this caveat before you let them loose or else you'll never get them back.
You go when I say time's up. I need you to stop, turn, look at me and wait for the next piece of instruction, okay? And then have some kind of clever way of doing it. Some people do the clap. You clap once, and then if you're around know, clap once.
If you can hear me, clap twice. A couple other people clap twice, and then so on and so forth until you get out. The whole group. You could do the Johnny and make some very weird noises. You can car or act like whatever.
You get everybody's attention. Okay, cool. Everybody's got their idea. You say go, you hit play, you're playing music. They're passing it. They're going crazy. Here's the thing. I thought the very first time I did this for a group of very senior individuals, and I don't mean age, just mean senior, right?
Tenured. I don't know the right word for that. Whatever. Important people, a lot of important people, I thought they would be a little bit duddy around this. They'd be like, oh, pass it here and pass it there, and oh, this isn't going to be very cool.
They got into it. I mean, the first time I did it told me it can be for any range of people from any kind of background. They will love this one. Something about passing an index card as many times as you can around the room to as many people is just funny.
I don't know why. It's just funny. Okay, so you get everybody's attention. You now tell them, all right, I want you to read what you have on your card. So hopefully you understand by now that if it's been passed around randomly four or five times, the odds of anybody knowing the card that they originally had, where it is and who it's from, or vice versa, the person that has the card, where it came from, et cetera, are close to zero.
Unless somebody's sitting there and watching everywhere that it goes, which they can't, because they have to pass their own card. So nobody knows where anybody's card is. It's fully anonymized, right?
And now you're going to do the next piece. You're going to tell them to read it, and if they strongly agree with it, they're going to flip it over on the back, and they're going to write a five. If they it absolutely oppose it.
They're going to put a zero. If it's okay, they'll put a one. If it's good, they'll put a two. If it's better, they'll put a three, et cetera, until you get to five. You're going to rate it zero to five.
Okay? Then you start the music again, they do it again. Then you do it again. You do it again. You do it again. And you would
 think that people would get really sick of passing cards and going to the next round, but they're, like, ready for it.

The human brain loves predictability and patterns. To help short-circuit traditional ideas, this tool forces participants to make connections from seemingly unrelated concepts, serving as a framework for the freedom of ideation and getting the group outside of the box.",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732284/lectures/39185882,,"Forced Connections, another tool to add to your brainstorming kit. Simple, straightforward, and at times uncomfortable, here's all you need. A list of random words, excited participants with sharpies and post -its, and a problem to be solved.
So make sure you have a concrete problem to be solved before you dive into brainstorming with Force Connections. Now, I'm going to give some examples to give you some more context. It is literally just that simple. Your brain needs a stimuli in order to power through and create more ideas.
That's what those words will do. So the example I'm going to give you today is, we are, as a company, Acne Bathtubs. You're a standard bathtub producer, and we have the goal, or the problem statement, of how might we make better bathtubs?
How might we improve our bathtubs? Now, that's a simple problem statement, but can be a difficult one to actually be innovative with. So we're going to force our brain to make some connections. So I'll dive in and give some examples of what that would look like.
Here's the setup. Participants are sitting around the table. There's a stack of papers with random words on them. It can easily be done online as well. You as the facilitator will flip over, just like in a game of cards.
Flip over the paper to reveal a word. The individuals will have one minute to come up with as many ideas that would solve our problem based on what they think of when they see that word. So we'll go with the first one.
Beach. So when I think of beach and how to improve bathtubs, I think of a walk -in bathtub. I think of a saltwater bathtub. I think of waves, so a wave pool in the bathtub. I think of relaxing sounds that might make my experience in this tub even better.
All right, let's go to the next one. Bananas. How can I banana a bathtub? How about a non -slip bathtub? No matter what you do, you can't slip, right? Easy enough. What about this one? Random. Airplane cockpit.
How can I airplane cockpit a bathtub? What I think about is glass. Could it be a glass bathtub so I have a beautiful view? Could it be outside? Could the bathtub fly? Or maybe it has controls that allow me to control the music, the amount of bubbles, and the temperature all in one.
So those, that's a simple example of what that exercise could be like. Remember, start with a concrete problem. We like to use the how -might. We structure the format, our problems, define it really well, then put that on the wall where everyone can see it.
Make it very visual. Have the stack of words pre -done and make them as random as possible. There are plenty of word generators online that can give you that list already made. And one by one, go through at least five to eight words of inspiration.
If as an alternative you find people are stuck on a word and aren't creating ideas, go ahead and move to the next word. You can put this out so people can do it on their own without you having to be there. Generate as many ideas as possible and, as always, have a single place to put everyone's ideas so that in one visual snapshot you can see all the variety of ideas.
And then use one of the prioritization tools, big word for a little guy, use one of the prioritization tools to figure out what ideas have the most opportunity or the most interest around them so that, moving forward, we can get to execution and action.
That is Force Connections. While it is similar to 100 photos, it's a different technique of the same tactic. Force your brain to have more ideas.",brainstorming,['The human brain loves predictability and patterns'],tools,beginner
Leaf Pile,Easy,3-30 participants.,,10-25 minutes,"When to use it?
Before: Discussing and prioritizing ideas.

Post-its & Sharpies for each participant. Space for throwing ideas. Rake is not needed but recommended.
What is it?
This is a huge mess. An exercise in filter-free thinking, a big pile of inspiration forces participants to dig deep and create more concepts. Evening cleaning up the mess uncovers more and more ideas/opportunities.",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732284/lectures/39185889,,"Leaf pile. This one is a ton of fun because people like to make messes everywhere. So you ask them to come up with an idea and you say, throw it on the ground. So now you're going to get people to just start throwing post it notes everywhere. They're going crazy. There's post it notes everywhere. It's like all over the place. And they're sticking together, but they're everywhere. They're just everywhere, all over. Okay, cool thing here. Get a big group of people together. Thank you, Johnny. You get a really good group of people together. Call it 30. They all get in a massive space in a circle, right? And they're going to, what is the problem we're attempting to solve? And you want them to throw as much in the middle as possible. A group of 30 won't look like a lot. If you could see what I see right now. They're just everywhere. It's a huge mess. Okay? And you don't need a rake that was just for show and maybe over the top, but the mess is real. If you can get a group of seven people in a school circle together or in a corner of a room to just come up with an idea and throw it on the ground, it's basically, it's freeing. It's allowing them to go, who cares if people like or hate my idea? I'm just going to write it and throw it very passively. Right? We're not going to sit here and talk forever. The whole objective is to make a mess on the ground, an actual mess, but you're going to write it down on a post it note with a sharpie and throw it on the ground as soon as you get it. So boom, throw it. Boom, throw it. And your group is just. So what ends up happening is some people will come run out of ideas, but you'll start to, you'll just keep seeing this person's seeing all these things being thrown and they realize they're not part of this mess. And so it almost, in a weird way, forces people to jump in and try to get messy and try to come up with an idea so they can throw one. Because for some reason, everybody likes to make a mess anyway. So at the very end, that's part one, part two of it is the very end. You attempt to pick up a color that wasn't yours or handwriting that you know is not yours, and you pick it up and you say something about it. The reason that this is impactful, valuable, is that it is, in a way, anonymous. If you come up with enough ideas and you grab a random one and you go, I like this because, or I like, I wish, I recommend. Or, oh, we could add this to this.
Or yes, and, and you add an idea. Or, oh, this is very similar to this one. Or the idea I had earlier. It allows you to have and dive into another discussion when you clean up the mess. So I recommend instead of having everybody clean them up one at a time, you say, all right, based on this mess, I've got this section. You've got that section, you've got this section. So if I'm here throwing them, maybe I'm going to walk over there and clean up that mess. They'll come over here and clean up this mess, etcetera, etcetera. Or you move them all into the center with your hands, you kick them, and then you just hand out stacks to everybody so that they can have this discussion after the fact. As you'll know and recall from some of our other stuff, it's the discussion and the so what that comes after these, that is valuable. These things are just to kind of get the energy where you need it and to, you know, get people involved. The people that don't really have a voice gets them a chance to, in a weird way, feel like they're contributing and definitely having the ideas that they otherwise wouldn't have had in a group full of, you know, 15, 2030 people all saying, your idea stinks because of this, that and the other. It's just a framework. So this is leaf pile. You can leave
the rake at home or you can bring it. Either way, leaf pile.",brainstorming,['This is a huge mess'],tools,beginner
100 Pics,Easy,"4-7 Participants per group, can have multiple groups",,10-15 minutes,"When to use it? Before: Prioritizing a solution.
After: An initial round brainstorming
Materials
A stack of 100 random (VERY RANDOM) pictures with no relation, Post-its & Sharpies for each participant.
What is it?
Think differently through random inspiration. Like the big bang, this is all about intentionally creating chaos to spark
an explosion of ideas. Many very bad ideas in the search for a handful of GREAT ones!",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732284/lectures/39185840,,"100 pictures. It could be 80 pictures. It could be 114 pictures. It doesn't matter. The idea is there's a ton of pictures. Okay. I like to potentially go on Google, find a ton of stuff that has nothing to do with the next thing and the next thing or why you're doing a workshop whatsoever. It could be a swimming pool or a bicycle or a dog or a cat. It could be beads hanging from a ceiling, fruit from all over the world. It can literally be anything that you want. The objective here is to get people to think a little bit differently through a different lens of their current idea creation, prototype, MVP, whatever. So what you're going to do is you don't need anything other than the pictures you see. Scatter them around a table. There's a lot of ways to do this. You can force give them to people. So, meaning they sit down at a desk and they are stuck with the one that they've got. Or you can spread it on a table and have them come up to the table and pick what speaks to them. The idea here is there's so many pictures, more pictures than people that are actually participating, that they'll be able to walk up, select one that speaks to them and kind of walk away. Now they have the postcard or picture or something in their hand, and now they're going to build upon the idea that they had before or use a different kind of scenario to move forward with their discussions, etcetera. So a really good way to do this is to have everybody zero in on the single best idea that they have moving forward, and then have them go to the table, grab the thing, and then build upon yes, and the idea and plus it up until they get to the next and the next and the next for the ultimate discussion that you're going to end up having. So I've also done this with postcards before. You can buy these online, maybe a little bit cheaper, and this will allow, or wherever you find postcards. And you can do it where you have objects for one stack and you have kind of Personas for another stack. So just random people. Totally random people or superheroes or whatever. It doesn't matter. Two different tables. They pick up two. They pick up one from this one and one from that one. Now they're going to use this new person and this object to bring them together and build upon the story of the idea that you had. I know that sounds crazy, but when you force people to do it, they're going to draw out things that you never thought possible. They're going to say, oh, because of this green background, I noticed that we are attempting to save a lot of Energy here. And we're going to save energy by accomplishing x, Y and z by lmNop. Right. People are going to pull out what they see, what they feel, and it's just kind of allowing them to take a step back, see the forest through the trees, so to speak, and remove themselves from how much they're stuck in their idea or thought, and move them to the side so that they can kind of, you know, create some depth to it. So you don't need 100 pictures. You might have 200. It really depends on how many people you have. I'd argue that you can do this entire thing with a group of 30 people in about five minutes, enough for them to come up with an idea, grab it, and ideate on that. Now, the discussion, obviously, is going to last a lot longer than that.
And if you do the one where I mentioned before, where you have the superheroes or the Personas, etcetera, and another pile over here for the objects, I double that. Maybe at least make it ten minutes or so so they can kind of really get settled into who their Persona is.

Picasso? Meh. Finger painting, maybe. In this exercise, participants will get the chance to share and inspire others with their own idea. Silently, they will rotate around
the room observing, stealing, and combining ideas from others into new opportunities. See you at the Louvre!",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732284/lectures/39185841,,"This is an example of how you can have somebody teach you a module two minutes ago and then provide it as if you know exactly what you're talking about. And part of being a facilitator is that confidence to be able to tell people what they need to do, have them go where they need to go, etcetera. So this was Johnny's module. He was coming up here and we decided to let me try it out. So I'm going to tell you all about what Johnny Drew. This is called art show, and the whole purpose of doing this is to very rapidly get your ideas out and be able to showcase and see where everybody else is in a room, to be able to plus it up and have discussions as you go. So really all you need is a piece of paper sharpie for everybody so that they can pass it around. If you want to have dots and whatnot, you can get into that later. You can make this one your own, but that's where you start. You do not have to be a Picasso. I don't know why I say Picasso, I guess. I don't know a lot of other artists. Maybe Salvador Dali. Yeah, let's go with that one. So this is what you're going to do. I'm going to get this super close. You're going to do a catchy name, you're going to do a sketch, and you'll have the value of the idea. That's all you need to do. You need to remember three things, really. If you're in a workshop, you need to tell them four things. Number one, catchy name. Number two, sketch. Number three, value of idea. Number four, have fun. And who cares how terrible you are at drawing? You can make this anonymous if you want. Or you could have them sign their name at the bottom if they've just got a work of art here. So here's some examples of what you're going to ask them to do. All right, we've got dolphin sneaks. There's a really awesome picture that Johnny drew of a dolphin wearing sneaks. And I'm going to read this. It says, keep non land mammals comfortable on land. It's a brilliant idea. Good job, Johnny. The next one, not a mint. So this is to avoid all, all close talkers. And it says, great taste, bad smell. Here's the thing. You're going to get people to put these on the wall around or on a table, depending on what your setting looks like. And when they're done, they're going to kind of go around like an art show and they're going to see what everybody else has and take notes.
So you might want to put like a one above the first one and a two and so on and so forth. So that when they go and paste it up there, or use painters tape and whatnot and paste it up there, you're able to go, okay, on number one, this is what I noticed. This is what I love. This is what I would do to make it different. This is how I could. Blah, blah, blah. Right, you've heard us before. I like, I wish, I recommend there's some other things that you can do to either plus up their idea or make your own. Right. They're going to go around the art show and list out to themselves what they think they can do to make it better. Now, you do a second round. This second round allows you to steal from other people's artistic beauty. And I don't just mean in the sense of drawing, I mean in the sense of names, in the sense of the so what? Behind that idea, solution set, etcetera. And that is you go around, you maybe make it a little bit faster, add some music to it, and now you get to see, okay, well, hey, there was four or five really, really good ideas that everybody saw, and now they're emulating those ideas or plusing them up, etcetera. When you get to the end. I don't know, I've never been to an art show, but I would imagine at the end you talk about how really cool the artist is. Maybe this is similar where you get to the end and you have a discussion about what
they thought, how you could make it better, etcetera, and kind of work together as a team to kind of have that camaraderie around the idea and potentially that buy in to move forward with that idea. So to wrap this up, Johnny told me this about two minutes before we started. I started rolling. I think I told you maybe seven times the amount that Johnny did before we started, just to see if you could confidently learn something new and execute it. So all the things that Johnny and I are going through right now, you should be able to make it your own, you should be able to make the title your own, change the way that you do it in a little small fragments. I would not leap too far off of what we've done right out of the gate if you're new to facilitation, because you might not know what worked or didn't work because of that change. So make the tweaks and changes on your own. That one is called art show.",brainstorming,['Picasso? Meh'],tools,beginner

But batters box will be a really good one for you in your workshops, whether it's a meeting, etcetera, is to move people along very quickly and prepare the next person or people or group of people to come up with their thought, idea, discussion point, et cetera. It's simple. You have the single place that you're going to have everybody speak from. Call that where I'm standing right now. You designate an area off to the side, either over here or over here, where the next person is up and they know they're up. So it's one thing where we're all actively listening to the person going. It's another to put somebody in the batter's box who might need to be thinking about what they're going to say next. And it's okay that they're sitting there potentially not fully involved in this next person. In my opinion, some of you may not agree, and that's okay. Either way, the batter's box allows you to say, all right, you, you're up next. You're up on deck. You're on deck, you're coming next. And you can kind of, as a facilitator, you can kind of poke and produce people to always fill the box. Now, you can put 2345 people in it. It can be a line, it can be one person, etcetera.

Brain vomit and passive ideas is a really good way to get everybody to kind of shake it out. Who cares if you mess this up or mess that up or if you get on somebody's nerves, et cetera, et cetera. Passive ideas. Okay, what do you need? You don't need anything. Nothing at all, except for a group of people willing to kind of jump in and be the first penguin to be pushed off the iceberg, right? Typically, when we give ideas and when we receive feedback, we either, if we're receiving it, we get defensive. Potentially, if we're giving it, we want to qualify why our idea is so good. Our idea is so good because of this, that, and the other, and oh, my gosh, you could save so much money and time and all the frustration that would melt away. And it's amazing because of this. And oh, my God, we could do it this way and that way, and all we really need is for her to sign this and for him to do that, and we're done. And everyone's like, instead of just saying, here's the idea, and move on. The reason that meetings last as long as they do, the reasons why workshops feel like they potentially drag on forever and ever is because you don't stop that feedback circle. You don't stop the people that are upset about something. Oh, but my idea was better because, or that that idea wasn't as good as mine because, or sticking up for your idea or whatever. Or another example would be somebody comes up with a great idea and you go, oh, yeah, that's a really good idea because of this, this and this. And I really like that idea. You've now spent more time talking about why that idea was good than potentially coming up with more thoughts, ideas, solution sets, etcetera. And so passive ideas is a way for you to say to everybody out loud, hey, look, you can say your piece in about five to 7 seconds, but when you're done, you are not allowed to talk anymore. There's no more qualifying your idea anymore. There's no more anything except for the next one and the next one and the next one. What you're going to find is it's going to go quicker. People aren't going to get upset. They're going to be okay with kind of just moving forward. If it was a really bad idea, nobody's going to spend five minutes talking about why it was a bad idea. If it was a really good one. Hopefully the next people that come in and talk about it in this discussion are going to come up with ideas that revolve around that one. They're going to plus it up in some way, shape or form if it really is genuinely good. So you're going to speed things up, the quality is going to be better, etcetera. And I guess the best way that I can explain this is I think the statistic has come out of my brain somewhere that doesn't exist in real life, but I believe this is true. I think we waste about 60% of our time when we're in meetings and in workshops talking about why something was either really good or really bad, as opposed to just being okay with what's the 75% of the stuff that we just agree on, and then we'll talk about the stuff we disagree on, or we'll talk about the way forward with the specific ones we want to move forward with, et cetera. So again, you don't need anything. I'm sure you can get people to write stuff down. I'm sure you could use this in the beginning of a discussion at the end of the day to wrap things up. This is just kind of a way of running almost any type of event that you are doing, any module or workshop event type of thing that's just going to help it move along faster and get people to just let go and brain vomit. Just no rhyme or reason. You say it, you move on, it's over.

You're going to need a bucket, bunch of sticky notes, sharpies or pieces of paper or whatever to put inside the bucket to hold ideas, thoughts, conclusions, etcetera. You can throw in the bucket. I prefer to have my bucket visible for everybody to see what's going into it just makes it look cool. You don't have to do that. You can get a, you know, three $3 bucket from Lowe's or Home Depot, and you can have several of them. I've done this before where I put seven or eight of these throughout the entire room. I label what they need to put before they have a thought going into it. We can get into that another time for this time. This is a way that you can get anonymous ideas from the crowd without having to put people on the spot and say, well, what were you thinking? Why were you thinking it? Etcetera. You can instead start by giving everybody sharpies and pens, you know, sharpies and sticky notes and going, all right, for this next exercise, I want you to come up with all the problems that we're having with this, or how might we improve that, or how might we, etcetera, fill in the gaps of whatever kind of question you want to get at. I'd be as specific as possible with your question because this is anonymous. So you want to pull, you want to pull some of these nuggets out of from the crowd. So I like to have a top to the bucket. The reason for that is once people put it in, if there's anything that is, you know, people want to get to afterwards, put the top on the bucket, make sure that it stays safe. It's a safe space. Right. We're all in this together. We're all, you know, working towards the same common goal here type of thing. Don't need to have a top for the bucket at all, but got a bucket. Now imagine you've got a ton of ideas. You can put one of these behind a board and basically start a line and have everybody, one by one, throwing these in. They're not actually saying out loud what these ideas are. Hopefully they get in the bucket and if they don't, you're there to kind of grab it. You're the anonymizer of this machine. Right. Anyways, they throw in all their ideas, they come through. Now, when it's done, that's the start. It's not the end of this exercise. You actually grab the bucket and you're going to reach in and go one by one and you're either going to read them out loud, which I like to do. It's somewhat awkward but potentially detrimental if somebody says anything that is just terrible in the positive or the negative, that just gets Everybody riled up right for the wrong reason. So what you can do is you do this right before a break. You send everybody on a big enough break that you can pull, pull all of these from it. You can sit there with a co facilitator or yourself and put them into bins or buckets or categories, whatever you want to call them, right? So that when everybody gets back, you can say, hey, the common theme of what I asked you was this, and I'd like to zero in on this comment and that comment and this problem or this solution. And then you're going to have a meaningful discussion about what wound up in the bucket. Keep the stuff that's in this. This will help you for your after action report.
This will help you for prompting discussion later on. It will prompt you for looking back on the workshop and going, did we accomplish what we set out to do? Or maybe you do the exact same thing at the end and go, are any of these things going to be better from the solutions that we've come up with today and kind of get that feedback from everybody. I have used this one for a very pointed feedback for the boss. What do you not like about the
boss? I get their permission beforehand. We've talked about this before with Johnny. Get their permission. If they say yes, you have one of these buckets and people throw it in on their way out. It's totally anonymous. Instead of letting the handwriting pass on to the boss, you rewrite or retype all of them so that you can just give a very candid, this is what your people think of you response to the boss. And if they're open to that kind of culture and that kind of, you know, self improvement type of thing, it is beneficial. You can use this for a million different exercises. I love it. This is called bucket bonanza. It will not take very long, depending on how many people you have just to get everybody to think of the ideas or thoughts, solutions, problems and throw them in the bucket. I like to save more time for that discussion, that meaningful discussion than the bucket itself, but this is a way to anonymize their thoughts.",brainstorming,['A method for gathering anonymous ideas from the crowd'],tools,beginner

Simple, straightforward, and at times uncomfortable. Here's all you need. A list of random words, excited participants with sharpies and post its, and a problem to be solved. So make sure you have a concrete problem to be solved before you dive into brainstorming with force connections. Now I'm going to give some examples to give you some more context. It is literally just that simple. Your brain needs a stimuli in order to power through and create more ideas. That's what those words will do. So the example I'm going to give you today is we are, as a company, acme bathtubs, your standard bathtub producer. And we have the goal or the problem statement of how might we make better bathtubs? How might we improve our bathtubs? Now that's a simple problem statement, but can be a difficult one to actually be innovative with. So we're going to force our brain to make some connections. So I'll dive in and give some examples of what that would look like. Here's the setup. Participants are sitting around the table. There's a stack of papers with random words on them. Can easily be done online as well. You, as the facilitator will flip over, just like in a game of cards, flip over the paper to reveal a word. The individuals will have 1 minute to come up with as many ideas that would solve our problem based on what they think of when they see that word. So we'll go with the first one. Beach. So when I think of beach and how to improve bathtubs, I think of a walk in bathtub. I think of a saltwater bathtub. I think of waves. So a wave pool in the bathtub. I think of relaxing sounds that might make my experience in this tub even better. All right, let's go to the next one. Bananas. How can I banana a bathtub? How about a non slip bathtub? No matter what you do, you can't slip, right? Easy enough. What about this one? Random airplane cockpit. How can I. Airplane cockpit. A bathtub. What I think about is glass.
Could it be a glass bathtub? So I have a beautiful view. Could it be outside? Could the bathtub fly? Or maybe it has controls that allow me to control the music, the amount of bubbles, and the temperature all in one. So those, that's a simple example of what that exercise could be like. Remember, start with a concrete problem. We like to use the how might we structure the format our problems? Define it really well. Then put that on the wall where everyone can see it. Make it very visual. Have the stack of words pre done and make them as random as possible. There are plenty of word generators online that can give you that list already made and one by one go through at least five to eight words of inspiration. If as an alternative, you find people are stuck on a word and aren't creating ideas, go ahead and move to the next word. You can put this out so people can do it on their own without you having to be there. Generate as many ideas as possible and as always, have a single place to put everyone's ideas so that in one visual snapshot you can see all the variety of ideas and then use one of the prioritization tools. Big word for a little guy. Use one of the prioritization tools to figure out what ideas have the most opportunity or the most interest around them so that moving forward we can get to execution and action. That is forced connections. While it is similar to 100 photos, it's a different technique of the same tactic.

Similar to an alternative exercise, brain writing is more an individual exercise, an individual deep dive into ideating. What you're going to want to do is first make sure you're at the point in the process of needing to create lots of ideas. You're going to need to give each participant a simple sheet of a one paper, which you will show them how to fold. You'll fold it into eight equal rectangles, folding it tall ways twice, and then folding it one more time to make eight equal rectangles. Now, what your participants are going to want to do is start by creating one initial idea. That initial idea can go in the top corner of the page where I have one written. Okay, and now what you're going to do is put them on the clock. They will then have 45 seconds to improve upon that original idea or completely change it. Whoo. That was tough, right? 45 seconds to create a whole new idea. Well, it turns out you're going to have to repeat that over and over again until we finish and fill out this entire page. Now, if your participants aren't able to create an idea that round, it's totally okay. Tell them to catch their breath, leave that one blank, and move on to the next one. We're not going to leave anybody behind. It isn't time crunched, intense exercise, which many people can find overwhelming. What it does is by putting that number, the amount of time, the hyped energy in the room, it forces you to get out of your own way and put really what your gut is feeling about that idea. No more logic or questioning the shortcomings, but directly diving into, let's throw out as many solutions as possible. So in just a matter of eight minutes, essentially a little bit less. If you're totaling up 45 seconds, in a little bit less than eight minutes, you're able to create eight completely unique ideas by building a pawn or throwing out and completely putting in a random concept on the page. It feels a little bit forced at first, but then it gets increasingly more fun as you get used to the process. Again, this is similar to brain writing, but as opposed to sharing the paper throughout the room where you're given a random idea and asked to add onto it, these are your own ideas, your own concepts that you're trying to make unique to yourself. So it forces you again to think outside of the box in a very short amount of time. And if you have a group of people, say, five to seven or more in the room, you can ask each individual to circle their favorite idea of the bunch, draw it out a little clearer, and then present it to the rest of the group for insights, for note taking, for narrowing down on our next steps on our solution.

Creative Matrix,Medium,"Up to 5 participants per group, can have multiple groups",,20-25 Minutes,A systematic ideation process that utilizes a matrix format to generate and combine ideas from different categories and user groups. This exercise consists of timed brainstorming sessions and rapid idea sharing to ensure a broad range of concepts are explored.,https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732284/lectures/39185869,,"Keanu. Whoa. The matrix of creativity. Thanks, Keanu, for the introduction. In this simple exercise, which you can really, you put everything into a box so there's no confusion. You walk your participants through forced brainstorming activity. That means you're going to have to draw two points together to create ideas. Now, as you can see to my side, I have an example already created. This is based on a concrete problem. So before you start this exercise, you are going to want to have a problem well defined and well listed out. Maybe that's with a how might we statement. So our problem that we're trying to solve right now is how might we make package holiday vacations more attractive to our customers? For this exercise, which takes about 20 to 25 minutes, depending on how crazy you go, you can have up to five participants per group anymore, and this board gets way too crowded. You'll need a much larger board and many more flip charts. I think, best practice, you could probably spread this out three times the amount of what I have right here so that each square has enough space for five to six ideas. Participants will need a fat stack of post its sharpies. Bring back up sharpies, as always, and some creativity juices already flowing. So, with our concrete problem of how to make packaged vacations more attractive to our customers, the first thing we're going to do is write out all of our customers. So get the group to do it on their own. Define a handful of customers for this creativity matrix. Don't make it more than, I'd say, five or six wide just because you will get lost. You can make it wider if you're feeling more ambitious, but it just really kind of zaps all the energy once you hit that five list wall. So we've got an example here of the different users, families, couples, young singles, and retirees. These are all people that could purchase a packaged vacation. Simple enough. The next step that we're going to do is define the categories. The categories go up and down, the users go left to right. Okay, so the categories, again, this is an opportunity to brainstorm. In this scenario, what we want to do is break down the common blocks that make up whatever we're trying to solve. Whatever that package, in this case, is, the categories you can brainstorm as a group. I find that to be best practices. If you're an experienced facilitator, simply listening to the room and the situation, you can summarize them on your own and plop them up there so that the participants themselves don't have to get stressed out about finding each category. Now, in order to complete the exercise, what you're going to do is give everyone five minutes to silently try and fill up this entire board with as many ideas as possible. That is, sitting down, writing ideas, post its, post its, post its, flying through them, trying to connect families with partnerships. What idea could we offer in the vacation setting? Vacation. I said it funny, the vacation setting for families. And we mix in partnerships or discounts, right? Come up with as many ideas. Once you run dry on that individual square, move to the next one.
Continue through until you've completed all the different sections. Now, at the end of five minutes, you may have not gotten through everything. That is okay. There should be enough ideas on the board to start inspiring you more in the next five minutes. What we're going to do is start sharing ideas out loud and building on the ideas of others. That's a yes. And trying to add to the ideas that you already have on the board. Combine two, subtract one, put it in a new place, have an idea for family that you then can apply to young singles,
get creative in mixing and matching, and continue to fill the board till it's almost overwhelming. Now, after these ten to twelve minutes of brainstorming, everyone probably is a little tired. They'll be on their feet, but they'll be tired. But we'll be able to then narrow it down using some of the conversion exercises we have. In other sections, you can simply look at the board, discuss. You should already know the majority of the ideas up there from your conversations as participants, and then pick the handful of ideas that seem the most interesting and move them on to the next round. So, creativity matrix. The basics are you're going to pick users, you're going to pick categories, and you're going to intentionally, within the squares, try and force ideas with both inclusion and young singles or families and experiences to try and force your brain into generating ideas. Like I've said many times before, and I'll continue to say it because it's so true, brains need framework. Humans need framework. Creativity needs framework. In this exercise, you literally have a framework, a box, to help instigate your innovative ideas, and you can do it all in under 20 or 25 minutes.",brainstorming,[],tools,beginner

You need your random objects post its for each participant, sharpies and about ten minutes of time, because you might need to recover from laughter. So each round will have one object in one to two minutes of time for individuals to create as many concepts or solutions as possible. I'm going to do an abbreviated version, picking up an object, shouting out an idea. I recommend individually, silently writing down your ideas after each round. After each object, let everyone stand up and share their ideas. Talk about the similarities, talk about how you can combine them together. Yes. And the ideas and potentially keep one and execute upon it. So here we go. I'm going to reach down here, I'm going to grab something, and then I'm going to try and make an idea about how we could make chocolate chip cookies better based on that object. Object one, this cord thingy. So I think electricity. We could put pop rocks in the chocolate chip cookies for a more interactive flavor. I see that it's standard. We could make sure that each chocolate chip cookie has the exact same amount of chocolate chips so that we're never eating one bite without a good ratio of chocolate chip to the sugary sweetness and butteriness of the cookie. So there's one cheesy crackers. I'm thinking add some sea salt to the top of the chocolate chip cookies because I see sea salt thinking crunchiness. Is there a way we can make them wafer thick so that there's an added crunchiness? Cheese. I don't really have anything for cheese. I'm not gonna lie. I don't really want cheese. But I do think we could make a chocolate chip cookie sandwich. And that's an option there. So inspiration. Last one. This is pretty on the nose. Baking gloves. Baking gloves. Rubber. Rubber.
Is there a benefit to cooking chocolate chip cookies on a silicon pan? Could we make patterns in the chocolate chip cookies so that they are like designer grade chocolate chip cookies? Thinking, what if we only serve our chocolate chip cookies piping hot? Is there a way to make sure chocolate chip cookies are gooey forever? Those are the ideas I've come up with based on three random objects. I didn't prepare this, so I didn't cheat.

So a customer can pick it up, look at it, and learn everything they need to know about it before deciding whether or not they need it. I have made, and because I'm terrible at wrapping, I have made a box here myself. So we're going to start off with the first and most easy, well, the easiest side to do, which is naming of the box and coming up with a slogan. So you will name your idea and come up with a slogan about it. Next, you're going to write the key benefits of that idea. Why is this idea valuable on the other side? Boop. Of course we're going to say how to use it. Are there requirements for using it? Are there requirements on our end for making it? And of course, on the back we've got this definition of the customer type. This can be actually a Persona that you fill out. But who is this product for? Simple, straightforward. If you want to get even farther into conversation, you can ask them to describe what they would fill the box with. That can be the context of the idea itself, the detailed description of the idea. That can be what's inside of it. Easy to do. If there are other factors, like an expiration date, you can put that on top of when the idea or project should be completed. It's a simple, straightforward exercise, which I love, that allows all individuals to get excited, get creative, and really well define their idea. After each group is finished, I like to give them 20 to 30 minutes to really try and decorate this thing as incredible as possible. I'll have colored markers, stickers, everything you can imagine for an intense arts and crafts adventure to build these boxes. Now, the best boxes you can probably find are going to be at your common FedEx store. Walmart has some really cheap options for less than a dollar not to give them a sponsorship, but we haven't given out a sponsorship in a while. A little shout out. So after each group finishes their boxes, maybe 20 to 25 minutes in. I like to give each group two minutes max two and a half minutes to share their ideas. We'll set up like a stage and they'll have a pitch where they describe the box, they tell each side of it, and they walk through what it actually is and how they're going to get it done. After each group goes well, hopefully they'll have fans of their idea.
I allow for an applause session at the end for each idea for voting. Or you can actually do the bucket approach, which is mentioned in another video where you vote by simply dropping your post it into a bucket underneath the idea they like the most. While everyone is sharing. An interesting extra that you can do for your participants is ask them all to take notes on the ideas, track what they liked about each, and how they could add it onto their own concepts. This is kind of a middle ground of ideas in the process of brainstorming. So you have a defined idea, a defined product, but it allows you to continue enhancing it by
stealing from the concepts of others in the room. And since we're all in one organization, building a better overall project, process or product, or maybe even even a person, and that is the product box can be called the cereal game. It is entirely too fun to end a workshop, so I highly recommend it.",brainstorming,"['What’s in the box??? Instead of building “the thing”\n, create an effective description']",tools,beginner

In this simple exercise, you're going to try and generate an incredible quantity of ideas, focusing in on the existing topic or the existing way things are done and trying to expand them into completely new things by following the step by step guide I have here to the right. So scamper is also known by Osborne's method or Kipling's method. It is just an acronym that spells out substitute, combine, adapt, modify, put to another use, eliminate, or reverse. So, scamper, when you put it all together, this technique is often used by product teams in order to expand upon the ideas that they currently have. Maybe they're too focused in and they need an intentional stimuli. Again, this is just by putting a filter on you, a focus point. It helps you. Humans need framework in order to be creative. This is an incredible framework to keep you on some rails, building on ideas. Straightforward. Now, you're shifting every few minutes in order to do this exercise. I think it's best in even smaller groups than I normally suggest. So in groups of three to five, each individual group can have their own scamper board. Everyone needs post its and pins. We also encourage drawing a lot more in this exercise as it helps enhance your creativity. Your creativity. I lost my voice for a second. Here's how you do it. I'm going to give you an example of a physical product, and then we're going to talk a little bit about how you could apply it to onboarding or hr and expand from there so that, you know, this isn't just about physical things. It could be digital, it also could be experiential. So it falls into an excellent exercise for all different scenarios. So we're going to start looking at our scamper board that we have today. I have written a lollipop. So a lollipop is what we're going to try and ideate on. Now, I've only put one idea per section. I like to divide this up into two minute windows that you are time boxing on purpose. So for substitute, we have two minutes to come up with a way to make a lollipop and substitute some item on it for something else. So in this example, a lollipop. Well, let's take away the stick and let's make it a string. Now we have a bracelet for a lollipop. Done. We can move on to the next one. Again, try and create as many ideas as you can in that two minute window. You can encourage your participants just to pick their one or two best ideas so that you don't overwhelm the flip chart. That's simple enough. I also like to keep a single color for each section, or at least have three colors here and three colors here so that visually, again, it's not overwhelming. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to go through some of the examples really quickly so that you can get some context, and then we're going to come back and talk about it.
So, a lollipop. We know how you can substitute for it. How can you combine it? Well, maybe we can make our lollipops medicinal. So now I have a sore throat. I can lick the lollipop. It's delicious. It also helps me lollipop. How do we adapt it? Well, maybe instead of a temporary stick, which is my straw that I use every day, I can have a variety of lollipop options that I just plug the stick in and I'm good to go. How do we modify it? Maybe we modify who the user of the lollipop is. So we think of adults. We can season the lollipop for adults, so maybe it has a more beautiful, robust flavor to it. Now, lollipop, how do we put it to another use? Well, maybe it's one that just connects to your finger, much like a ring pop, but on the end of your finger, so that you can lick as you go or you can point. Maybe we can put it to

another use by making it spicier so that we can test the different spices that we're gonna try at the indian restaurant tonight, because we like to have an idea of how spicy things are before we actually dive in. Eliminate. Maybe we eliminate the stick altogether and we just make mini little ones similar to a tic tac. Maybe we partner with tic tac so that they get our flavors. They make our little, tiny, round, delicious non lollipops. Or maybe we reverse it. So instead of a lollipop altogether, before we make the pop, the lollipop solid concrete, we know that there's a liquid flavoring. What if we put that into a drink and we called it lollipop like soda pop, huh? So a variety of ideas that are very simple, very visual by thinking through the filters that we're given. So the tough part for individuals in this exercise is actually a lot of times they get caught up on an individual word and an individual meaning. Because I gave you these examples, you're probably going to lean towards similar ideas yourself. So you have to be very careful with the examples you give. If an individual gets stuck on the difference between combine and eliminate, let them know it's completely okay if you have a similar idea for one or the other. Our goal is to have as many ideas as possible. So if you can find a way to adjust it slightly so that it is more unique. Meaning, it's great that we had bracelet here. It would be tough if you had earrings here, because then we're just really getting stuck on a single theme and we're not generating the same quantity ideas we're capable of. So see if you can encourage them to shift their focus and find a different meaning of the word so that they can have more ideas. Again, this is all about idea generation, a forced change of perspective, similar to some of the other exercises we've done in the past. I like to have my participants go through the entire board again with that time box. Two minutes. At the end of time, we're still under 15 minutes. Everyone can share their ideas. Pick the top two or three that they think are amazing, get them together, let the group vote on some of those ideas.
And again, we can go back through if we have some incredible ideas and see how can we combine one or two of these ideas to make it even better. Is there something we can take away from one of these ideas to make it simpler and easier to use? It's an incredible, incredible tool that you can continuously innovate upon, no matter how deep you are in the design of the experience of the product of the process. This is called scamper. Again, it could be called by other names, such as the Osborne map or Kipling's method. I'm keeping it simple because there's a lot of resources to support this version of it online. We love it for the ideation phase, whether that is a digital or physical product, or. Here's an example for HR onboarding. So when we look at how are we going to do the scan for HR onboarding, put the topic in the middle and we think of how could we put it to another use? Onboarding. What if onboarding was actually on the job so that the experience of becoming part of the company was training as well, or it was feet on the ground knowledge that they could get. Maybe we can eliminate it altogether. Maybe there's no onboarding and everything is show up and just dive straight in. What if we reverse it? What if we treated their first day like it was their last day and that was our onboarding? What would that experience be like? And walk through those conversations so even in a snapshot, in a few seconds, we're able to see the value of this scamper exercise, whether it's physical, digital, or experiential. I look

forward to hearing how you use it, totally open to any questions. Send them our way so that we can help guide you through this experience on your own. Three to four participants per board. I would say 20 to 25 minutes to get the whole exercise completed. If you are broken into groups, have them all stand up and share their highlights, the top three or four ideas that they've come and that they've created from their exercise, so that all the groups can have all the ideas on the table.

Now, you may have seen them online. I'm going to walk you through this exercise, but first, let's talk materials. Flip chart for gathering ideas. Post its for writing ideas, sharpies for drawing ideas, and probably some dots for picking the best of the ideas. You can do this with as many participants as you want, but you're going to break up into teams of two or three. Each team will always have to create a team name, which can be their idea name, and they're going to be isolated in their separate little pockets for the majority of the exercise. Okay, so like I said, this is a brainstorming technique for when you're stuck and you just feel like there's no way out. This forces you to create the worst idea ever so that you can at least get some ideas out and then start building from there. The worst place you can be is completely trapped and without motion. Motion. Continued motion in the science world means that it's easier to keep you moving. That's what this exercise does. It can be used almost as a precursor to a big, huge brainstorming session. It can be an opportunity to break the pattern or the frustration that you have in the group, or it can just be something playful to do whenever there's just a lull in energy amongst the room. So I'm going to give you the walkthrough of how to use this whenever you're just trying to use it for a brainstorming tool. So, worst idea ever. What you're going to do, and what I like to do is have a few examples of chindangu on hands. I have one drawn up on the top left. I like to show actual videos or photos. If you want to find some funny, hilarious innovations, inventions that aren't really so practical, you can go to unnecessary inventions on Instagram or the website. Unnecessary inventions. Super playful, great examples to get people kind of inspired and in the mood to come up with some really bad ideas. So chindongu is an object or an idea that's seemingly completely useless, doesn't exist today, and it is a tool for everyday life. You can give them that context before you show them the examples. Now, for us and for our situation, we actually need to solve a problem. So we can't just make a stick of butter that you carry around everywhere you go because you really like toast or avocado to go, guacamole to go for those hipsters out there the same way, in this case, we actually have a real problem that we need to solve. We're just stuck. We can't find a way out and think of even any idea. So we're going to purposely try and think of what's the worst idea possible for this situation? How could we make this situation ten times worse? Now, that will be the prompt that you ask. All the different teams, set them up on their own, hit them with the prompt, and allow them to have five to seven minutes to individually brainstorm, probably for three to four minutes, and then three to four minutes to discuss the different ideas that they've come up with. Now, have them draw every idea and write a small description of the idea underneath. Drawing it, it just makes it more playful, more engaging, so that when we are sharing people from far away, people that aren't there actually listening to it, that just walk by the flip chart later on, can kind of consume the idea easily. Again, we're going to give them the prompt. How could we make this problem worse? What's the worst idea we could have to solve this problem? We'll give them three to four minutes to brainstorm, three to four minutes to discuss and choose one to two of their favorite awful, horrible ideas. We'll gather up all the groups, and we'll share amongst everyone the highlights of what we've created.

The goal of this is to make everyone comfortable with having ideas. Get people to start at least having their first idea, even if it is intentionally bad, and the opportunity to actually recognize the flaws in the system. If we can ideate ways to make it worse, we can reverse engineer that into an idea to make it much, much better. Now, it is a starting point. It is not your final destination. Do not pitch this exercise as the whole enchilada. This is a break in the pattern. This is a starting point for you to build into better ideas. Get out of the habit, get out of the spot that you're stuck in, and get the group with their brainstorming, with their ideas flowing once again. I call it chindangu because I love to give those examples. It's playful, it's fun. You can call it worst idea ever. Regardless, it'll help your group get moving, get in motion, so that you're able to create better solutions.",brainstorming,"['When the groups get stuck on perfection, hit the reset\nbutton']",tools,beginner

We've all tried to think about the amazing lives and ideas of other individuals. In this exercise, we actually are going to encourage it. So this simple exercise is for brainstorming. I like to do it in groups, five to seven. Easy enough, you can do it with more. Always break up the groups and keep them small. The materials you'll need. Flip chart, post it, note sharpie. And before we get started, what you're going to want to do is generate a list of inspirational individuals. Men, women, present or past, as many as you can. Try and have those on hand. I like to source those from the group and see where we're thinking, what direction we're heading. Here's the simple situation. We're going to use this question to try and think as if we were that individual. Similar to the tool Medici method. So if I were, say, a creative individual trying to solve a problem, who would that be? I'm going to give the example of Walt Disney. That's a standard example that many of us can relate to. You don't want to be too obscure with the individuals to where no one in the room knows them. The goal is that they have an understanding perspective on this individual and how they think, and then they try and mimic their train of thought. This exercise forces us to take on a role. And that role, a lot of times, can encourage new, fresh ideas by looking at the problem from a different perspective. I like to give everybody three or four minutes. If we just have a handful of individuals, each single individual, we can do a little brainstorming around on. So if you have five individuals, just do a minute and a half per individual. Encourage everyone to create as many ideas as possible so that whenever we're done with this one, take it off, put up the next individual and get the brainstorming again. I want to reiterate, although it is very simple to say I'm thinking like Walt Disney, therefore I'm going to have these ideas. It's incredibly powerful. Do not underestimate the power of imagination and pretend acting. Role playing as if you were someone else will give you a new perspective will help you uncover more interesting, more unique ideas. So here's the exercise. In summary, get the group together, no more than five to seven. Make sure each individual has sharpies and post its. Generate a list of inspirational individuals which everyone in the room has context with or understands who they are. You can also explain. Give some background on each of them. Prompt the question for small, short time boxed rounds time box rounds of brainstorming.
Share those ideas, prioritize using one of the methods we have in other tools, the options, and then go on to actually making it happen. Simple exercise can be completed in less than 20 minutes. The smaller the group, the speedier it will go. The longer the list of inspirational individuals, the more time you have to brainstorm. Do not try and make them brainstorm for more than eight minutes. People will be burnt out. People will be tired. You'll notice the quantity and quality of the ideas will fall. I like to keep it around three individuals for a total of six minutes. After that, we can take a break, stretch a little, and come back and do more if we're really, really hungry for ideas. Otherwise, those six minutes should generate some incredible opportunities. And that was if I were.",brainstorming,['A brainstorming tool that thrives on inspiration and imagination'],tools,beginner

icebreaker or introduction","About to start a workshop, need to gain a ton of credibility. Have about, we'll say, 35 to 40 people. I've done it with a lot more. It adds more time. Obviously, you can do this one in about 20 minutes. More than that. If you dive a little bit deeper, a little bit less than that, if you're kind of getting people going. The purpose of this one is to get where you are now, where you want to go, and kind of all the actionable, tangible things that you can do from where you are to where you need to go. Remove the red tape, talk to the right people, get the smart metrics, etc, etcetera, with a group. So in order to show you, I'm going to bring out my little whiteboard. Now, imagine this is on the side of a really big wall. Wall. I'm doing this so that you can see it and you can kind of make this your own. It does not have to be a mountain. You can do a lot of different shapes. I've done a u before. I've done an m. I mean, I've done a whole bunch of weird stuff. A couple different parallel lines. So this is what you do. Grab a roll of painter's tape. Boom. You tell everybody this line right here represents the status quo. This line is the status quo. Everything below this is where we're not meeting the mark, where we are running out of resources, time, energy, effort, where we suck, where we are not achieving what we want to achieve on a day to day basis, on a month to month basis, on a year to year basis, whatever that is, right? Status quo. You're going to have everybody go, all right, I want everybody big circle, right? I want you to think about what that means to you and write down at a minimum, one each of the status quo of where you are, of where your team is, of where the organization is as a whole. It doesn't matter. I try not to be prescriptive here. I let them think about the micro or the macro kind of as a whole. What is the status quo of the now for you, your organization, et cetera. They're going to write it all around. I'm going to tell them. You're going to put that here. The objective is imagine a whole bunch of people coming up, right? These are, these are just three, but imagine 40, 50, 6100. I've done this before with almost 200 things below this line of the status quo. Now, when you get them to come and share, what they're going to do is they're going to come up, they're going to put it on the board. They're going to turn around to everybody else and very loudly and very clearly say what it is.
They're not going to talk for more than 5 seconds. 5 seconds is because you don't want to get into a why you thought of this idea or it's just the idea super quick. Status quo is we stink at communication. We send too many emails. We x, Y and Z fill in the gaps, right? They're going to come up and do that. I like to make an example of somebody right out of the gate for talking either too long or talking while their back is to the audience like I just did. Okay? They need to turn around, face everybody, speak very loudly, very clearly. 5 seconds go. They say it, okay. Boom, they populate this. What I try to do at the end of this, and by the end, I mean I pull from people like, hey, I think a couple of you haven't gone yet. After everybody's gone at least once and we've run out of people in line to go, right, you can go as many times as you'd like, hopefully not more than once or twice at any given turn, get
back in line, go again, etcetera. At that point in time, I go, all right, I need four more. We're not going to move on to the next step until I have four more. And you'll see people writing. Usually you'll grab six or seven more, which is great. Cool line, status quo. Then you take your tape and you say, this represents everything above. This line represents utopia. If we could do what we wanted to do when we wanted to do it, achieve what we wanted to achieve, what would that look like? Okay, so it's in the clouds, right? Imagine this is a mountain. This is the climb from the status quo to utopia on either side, right? You can make your own analogy for this. This is just what I call it. I don't want to go super in depth because I do want to make you to make this your own. After you watch it. Everything up here is the status quo. Everything repeats. You give everybody a second or two to think of one at a minimum. One thing that is utopia. We would be doing this if, or we could achieve that if, et cetera. 5 seconds. They all get in a line, they post them up here. So now you've got a whole bunch up here. Now the challenge of this whole thing is you're going to typically find that there are a million of these, there are a ton of the status quo. And when you get people to do the utopia they won't come up with as many ideas for Utopia as they did for these. And I know you might be thinking, well, isn't that just the opposite?
If we really stink at communication, wouldn't you just say communication? Well, communication might lead to something else which leads to trust, which leads to camaraderie and et cetera. Better culture. Right? So you would write for Utopia. We have the best culture of any company or organization in this field. Boom, that would be utopia. So you're going to need to pull from people, maybe play some music, give everybody another minute. Hey, nobody else is coming up for 1 minute. I want everybody to think as hard as you can get. One more, start the line again. Boom, you got those? Okay, cool. Everything in the middle is the actionable tangible things that get you from here to here, get you from the status quo to the utopia. Now, if you say we're going to, this is just an easy example. If we want to improve communication, you're not just going to put improve communication. This is actionable tangible things, things that you can do today, tomorrow, next week, next month, etcetera. So what you're going to do instead is you're going to go, I want everybody right now to think of much more granular. We are going to start reading a book together on Tuesday. Next week. We'll decide at the end of, you know, this time on this date to read this book. To improve communication, you might need to give them a little bit more than 5 seconds to come up and explain those. Maybe 1010 is enough time for you to give an actionable, tangible solution set of the way ahead. So if we're sending too many emails, like we said, and Utopia is that we're in a groove and we don't have to send all those emails, et cetera, the actionable tangible might be everybody look into the emails that you're sending and determine who you need to remove from the CC line. I said what I just said in less than 10 seconds. It's an actionable tangible thing that we could pick up and move down the field later. Cool. So now everybody puts these in the middle. Cool. I do this at the beginning of a workshop for a lot of different reasons. I already mentioned one of them was building credibility. This is something that can be done in a very short amount of time that everybody visually sees. Imagine we've got 150, 50 down here, 50 up here, 20, 30, 50 in here. Ton of these ideas of where we are, where we want to go and how to get there as just

the starting point of the day they go, oh, my gosh, if we could do that in 20 minutes, 30 minutes, imagine what we'll be able to do for the rest of the day. So I get the naysayers on board really early with an exercise like this, I also use this. I try to record, I ask everybody if it's okay to record the audio from this exercise. And I use this for my report. I write through like, hey, I noticed out of 50 ideas that they put down here for the status quo, you had a theme going, and your theme was 30 of these different ideas or thoughts were negative towards this very specific thing. And I kind of highlight that, right? You'll be able to see that, and we'll have a discussion about those things after doing the mountain or whatever you want to call this.
And I try to tell people during a break, instead of saying, hey, you have a ten minute break, come back, you know, after your bio break, etcetera, I say, hey, you have 15 minutes. And whether you see this before you start your break or after this is part of your break, you need to go up and you need to find your single greatest utopia, actionable, tangible thought or idea and status quo, find your single best of all three, so that when we come back, we can have a meaningful discussion. Everybody's been standing kind of coming up, doing this for a while, so that by the time you give them a 15 minutes break, they're able to put some real thought into what they saw, what they heard, and kind of the body language of everybody else in the room. You know, you can see if somebody's putting something up that everybody agrees to, everyone's going to be like, oh, yeah, preach. Yes. That's exactly what's happening to me. And even though you've had everybody be quiet, right, it's only one person talking. There are grunts and moans. When people say good or bad things, they're like, no, no, that doesn't happen. Or, yes, that's happening all the time. Right? And you get to see it. So anyways, a very, very powerful one. I personally would use this for any audience. You can use this for your family at home to determine where you want to get better, where you want to go on vacation. You can use it for c suite executives, etcetera, and everywhere in between. This is a really good one for everybody to see where you are, where you want to go, and how to get there. This is the mountain.",whole song and dance,[],,

So I'm going to get everybody three, maybe four minutes to sit down and write down as many post its as possible about the good things that are happening today within our organization. You'll pause, wait for everyone. Now, it can be three, can be four minutes. What I like to do is eye it, watch how everyone's Sharpie is moving. When the majority of sharpies in the room have stopped, then you know, okay, we're running a little dry. We'll call it maybe give them ten more seconds to finish that last idea. Then you'll have everybody pick up their ideas, come over to what we'll call the sailboating map, and simply put up, well, they'll share one by one, their ideas. I like everybody stand in a semi circle, pick one individual to share all their ideas, and then as we go along, we cluster the similar ideas. What that does is allow us to save time finding the patterns because we're going building the patterns the entire time. So I'm going to repeat that. Everyone brainstorms for three to four minutes. They pick up all their ideas about what's going well in the company, and then they share them. Those could be ideas like lunch break benefits. It could be company gifts that they're giving out, or it could just be the coworkers. A lot of times with the positive, it's a little bit of fluff. It's just a good way to start off. It's really hard to jump straight to the negative for a lot of people and they get really sensitive about it and they don't dive as deep as they need to. So starting with the positive is just a feel good moment. And it's something that we can look back on and say, there are a lot of positives, a lot of good things within the company. Not all of it's bad. Now, when you do ask for the negative, which we're about to let everyone know, we're trying to dive deep, we're trying to figure out the core issues. So share whatever problems and hurdles you're having within the organization, within your department, and be descriptive. It'll be more helpful. So that's the importance of five to seven people, because the more people, the less likely the individuals are to share and the longer it's going to take to get all the opinions.
So problems, they could be as broad as lack of trust, which would change the direction of the workshop. It could just be that there's no snacks in the office or there's silos between departments, or the one we tackle a lot. There's too many meetings now. Too many meetings is still a high level problem that we need to dive deeper in. So once you've allowed everybody to share their good ideas or the positive things and the negative things, what you're going to want to do is create some kind of process for prioritizing the negative ideas. What I like to do is give everyone three to five votes. If there's more than twelve people, I'm confident I can give them three. If there's less than twelve people in the room, I just give them five each. Yeah, so that we can get a decent number of stickies. Give everybody a minute, two minutes to vote. What you'll see is everybody will vote on their ideas. You can move the ideas to show prioritization. And it turns out within this situation, within this fictitious company, lack of trust is the core issue. So with that in mind, with lack of trust being the unique focus that we're trying to solve for the rest of the meeting, we can move on to brainstorming. We'll show you, or you can go to right now, a bunch of brainstorming techniques to use. The most simple one would be put this at the top of a blank flip chart and then ask everyone, how might we solve lack of trust? In the organization. This is a really broad topic. You'll want to get more concrete on what you're discussing. Try and figure out why lack of trust isn't or why lack of trust is an issue altogether. You'll probably have some time for discussions. Break that down a little bit more with another tool. Or if it's something as simple as no snacks, let's figure out ways that we can make snacking easy for our employees. Whether that's a guy that has a little snack cart that goes around and tosses snacks, you know, has a horn or a siren. Snack time, making it an experience. It can be big problems, it can be small problems. But this simple format of drawing out what's in our sales, you know, pepping us up a little bit and then discussing the hard conversations, having the hard conversations with an organized format, it's a simple process to get you from. We're lost and frustrated to we know the problem and we have solutions to it in just 90 minutes. Enjoy.",whole song and dance,[],,

After: Identifying problems or solutions.","Need to get a whole bunch of ideas down into something that's actionable, tangible, in the now, in the later, in the whatever. Zombies is your tool. I have used this for every audience imaginable, from professionals to people that are into sports to kids to adults, c suite, military executives, admirals, generals, et cetera, all over the place. And it works. I think one of the reasons that this does work is people love stories. They love things that they can relate to. And this is a way to branch your mind away from the really hard task at hand, which is solving this problem or finding out what that problem even is to solve it in the first place. So being able to come up with a story and provide it in the very beginning and get them to kind of buy into that story, it's going to allow them to see their problem through a different lens, and ultimately it's going to allow them to remove emotion from the decision making process. I think that is the most important part of prioritizing anything, especially in a group, to have the buy in that we did this without emotions. We didn't have anybody come in and say, this is exactly how we're going to do it, and we're going to do it this way because I said so. That's not the case with this, not at all. So I'm going to try to speed through the story with you really quick so that you have the gist of it. I'm going to explain the why, who, what, when, where, et cetera. All you need for this one is a board, a wall, et cetera. You can do it on the ground, it doesn't matter as long as you can kind of take what the masses have and rack and stack it. Okay, so I don't like to pick more than, we'll say seven to nine items to rack and stack, but it's up to you. I would not go more than that unless you're willing to strap in for a very long time of waiting, because it will take a long time for people to kind of go through this. So I'm gonna get started. I start by telling everybody that the zombies are coming. It's a zombie apocalypse. There are 3 hours left before the zombies arrive here and it's total and pure chaos. Okay, I'm gonna pause super quick. This doesn't have to be zombies. So while I'm doing this, maybe think of some things that you would use. I've done this with Christmas before and Santa's elves. I've done it with insert blank. It doesn't matter as long as somebody has a problem and it's independent of the person or people solving that problem, it works. It's beautiful, I promise. So here we go. Zombies are coming. 3 hours, right? You have 3 hours to survive the night. Your only objective here, I'm telling this to the audience, the only objective that you have right now is to survive the night. So it doesn't matter what you're gonna do tomorrow. You don't have to come up with this master plan of how you're gonna will smith it over the mountains and make it to the promised land somewhere else. It is all about surviving the night. That's it. So instead of freaking out, you're gonna get real calm and discuss with your significant other, or if you're solo by yourself, what am I gonna do in the next 3 hours to maximize my time and ensure that I don't get totally wrecked or killed by these zombies? So you tell everybody, you throw the very first thing in the very middle, we're going on impact only. This is low impact, high impact.
It's an x axis only. I'm not worried about how hard it will be to get this thing, how much effort it will take to acquire it or build it. It is only the impact that it will have on surviving the night. So if you put that sentence in your head for whatever you're attempting to solve, it becomes easier. This is the impact on solving this. So Johnny talked before about the how might we. So you might have a how might we statement. You have a few categories of ideas of how might we solve x, Y and z. You're going to rack and stack them on the x axis. Gasoline. So you get everybody to nonverbally. Not right now, but you're getting them pumped and primed for this. The next thing that I put up, you're going to nonverbally tell me whether it is more impactful or less impactful than the item that I currently have. So it will be item in my hand versus item on the board. If the item in my hand is more impactful to surviving the night, you're going to put a thumbs up. If it is less impactful, you're going to put a thumbs down. Okay, so this isn't, you know, consider this like an eye exam.
Okay?
This isn't like, oh, my gosh, that's so much more impactful. It's this versus that. This versus that. It's an eye exam. Is a better than b, is c better than a? Et cetera, et cetera.
Okay.
And you do it one by one very incrementally. So the next thing you do, you say you have water. Again, you're telling everybody nonverbals. I don't want you screaming out your idea. On the count of three, everybody vote. One, two, three, vote. More impactful. Less impactful. Generally, you'll be able to read the room and see, okay, at least 60 or 70% of this entire room put a thumbs up. I'm going to do a thumbs up. If it's really close, then count it. Then we go with, and here's the thing, somebody will inevitably jump in and go, hey, did you know that water kills zombies? You're like, okay, first of all, I didn't know that. Second of all, no talking. This is nonverbals, okay? And there's a reason, and I'm going to get to the reason why we use nonverbals for this. It's to move this along very quickly. It's to wrap our minds around something that we can all agree on in the now to move to the next step, and so on and so forth. Okay, food. Start with the one on the left. Food versus gasoline. To surviving the night. Thumbs up, thumbs down, et cetera. They say thumbs down, you move it over here again, inevitably somebody might say, well, hey, you don't need to eat for like 14 days or 20 something days until you die. Um, whatever. Nonverbals. And it doesn't matter. That's another key piece of this. It doesn't matter. I try to get this across. We are using zombies for a reason, to let you know that this is the tool that does not matter. It's what you do with this tool after it's complete that matters. This is just, let's just get through the tool.
Okay?
And you're doing it in a fun loving way because the zombies, etcetera, right? Barricade, I always start with the thing in the middle, because if you're going to compare it to food, everybody's got a vote, then gas. Everybody's got to vote. Then water, everyone's got to

vote. If you do it based on gas, people vote up or down, and you either move it to the right or the left. So here, if they voted it up, you'd go, okay, well, what about water? If they voted it down, you would move water over and put barricade right in between. If it's more, you move it to the right. So let's just say, for instance, it's less impactful than water. You're going to move barricade in where water was move it over to the right.
Okay.
So now I'm going to fast track this alarm swiss family Robinson style. You're going to string up some cans and make sure you can hear when the zombies are coming so you know where they're coming from versus gasoline versus water.
Okay.
You throw it over here. Locks. We're going to lock all the doors. Someone's going to say well zombies don't have opposable thumbs. And you're like, it doesn't matter. It's just more opportunity for you to say it doesn't matter. And if people don't interrupt you, you interrupt yourself and say oh hey, it doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. Locks, gas barricade in between, water. Okay cool. So you're constantly moving these, you're moving them to the left, you're moving them to the right to make one straight line. It's not, this is so much more impactful than that or this is so less impactful than this. It's just, it's a line. It's impact only on surviving the night. It's not how long it will take us to get this. So let's say it will take 4 hours to wait in line to get gasoline but you only have 3 hours to survive the night.
Okay.
This is impact of the gasoline not the feasibility of getting or acquiring the gasoline. Lights go around all the house. Around the house. Turn off all the lights so the zombies can't see you. Apparently they can't see it in the dark. Whatever, it doesn't matter. You make up the story however you want to make up the story and then you put it down here. Okay cool. Everybody has voted so now there is buy in to this tool. The majority have ruled for every one of these. So if it's off, it's not off by that much. If this one beat that one and this one beat that one, the odds of this one beating this one and counting the numbers is significantly more. So it's in the realm of where it needs to be in impact. There's no way alarms are way up here. We don't stop and say well what if you turn your sprinkler system on and water kill zombies? It's gonna blah, blah, blah. That comes later. For right now, x axis only, impact only. Then you move on to feasibility. You say okay, we're going to do the exact same thing, high feasibility, low feasibility. I always make sure that we have the same definition of what feasibility means.
Okay.
Same thing with impact. Let's agree on what we're talking about here. So I say this is easy,

this is hard, this will take a lot of time. This is going to be quick. I want to do it. I don't want to do it, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Feasibility, high feasibility, low feasibility, call it whatever you want, as long as everybody agrees on what that thing is. Two independent variables. One is impact, one is feasibility. Then you hold the thing on the far left constant and just like you did on the x axis, you compare what's in your hand to what's here. Thumbs up means it is more feasible to get food than it is to make an alarm system.
Okay.
And I'm. Everybody would be voting here, right? Nonverbals up, down, you count them. But I'm just doing it. Rack and sack. To show you gasoline versus alarm. You make sure you say that they vote. You should always keep the thing in the same x so that when you're done, each sticky will, you will not run into more than one sticky on the x or more than one sticky on the y axis when you go through this. And if you're not math oriented, if you made a grid with all this stuff, you'd only run into one sticky at any given point. Okay, so barricade again, I don't start at the low one and go up and up. I start at the one right in the middle. So there's three. I pick the one in the center. I compare barricade to making alarms run around the house and throw stuff against all the windows and the doors so that if zombies do get in or have opposable thumb somehow and can get in or pick a lock, you got a barricade there. Okay, cool. They vote up. They vote up again, etcetera. Example, if you're doing locks, the feasibility of running around the house and locking all the windows and the doors is probably going to go really high. But let's say, for instance, somebody, the majority of everybody thinks that barricade's higher. Well, you would leave locks here right next to barricade and then you just move barricade up. So just like the x axis, you're going to move the stickies to get where the boats are. Water, move it down, move gasoline down. You're going to try to do it one sticky at a time in space so that there's obviously one sticky between here and gasoline, etcetera. Okay, again, I'm going super quick. Feasibility of turning out all the lights. Right. It's probably going to climb all the way to the top. You can put a gun in here you can guns and ammo, et cetera, et cetera. There's a ton of stuff that you can do, but you're going to wind up with impact low to high and feasibility low to high. Now, at the end of this, before you start, you go, the purpose of this entire thing was what comes next. So getting here is important. Let's not spend an hour to get here because the meat of this discussion is going to be pulled out now.
Okay?
So have people bear with you. You're potentially not going to do this with 30 people. I've done it with a ton. But ultimately you're teaching them how to do it so that they can go back and do it themselves. So let's say groups of five. You're going to have one person who's going to count the votes, right? So let's say we have two thumbs up and two thumbs down. The person that is counting the votes counts themselves and breaks the tie. They don't need to tell everybody why they broke the tie. They just break it and then it doesn't matter. You try to repeat it doesn't matter so many times throughout this exercise that people get to that

point and break the tie. And break the tie. As a facilitator, I've gone up to a lot of different groups and they're like, well, we can't decide. And I'm like, well, there's five of you. So if everybody voted. Oh, I didn't know I was supposed to count myself. Yes, count yourself. Break the tie. If you have even number of people flip a coin, it does not matter. Cool. You get to this point, you survive the night somehow with zombies. Cool. Now you're going to go into this next phase where you're going to describe and break this down.
Okay.
Hopefully by now you're recognizing that, yes, I use gasoline, food and water and locks and barricades and all this stuff for zombies, but this is impacting feasibility on anything, on our company culture, on our strategy, on our team building for 2022 or whatever the heck it is. Right.
Okay.
This is just to teach them how to do it so that they don't have to take notes because they remember the story. They remember how it all went down so they can do it on their own. I've had people call me years later and say I improved my swimming time because of that zombies thing that you did. Awesome. I always say, like, how did you do that? And they break it down. So this can be individually, it can be for your family, it can be for groups of people, it really doesn't matter. This is just a very good prioritization tool. Cool. You do kind of like a grid here, and maybe you've heard of this before, but it's a pic chart. It's a possible implement, challenge, and kill. I'll say it again. Possible implement, challenge, and kill. There are two more exercises that play off of this one. So at the risk of ruining this video, I'm going to end this one here as part one and I'll bring you into part two. Talking about the pic chart and moving forward with this prioritization matrix. This is zombies, and hopefully I don't have a really good one. I thought I'd come up with something funny about zombies. I didn't. Hopefully you don't get eaten by zombies.

After: Identifying problems or solutions.","So we already went through the zombie apocalypse and we were stuck here at the end with a PIc chart. We said possible implement, challenge and kill. So you can allow, you can skip everything we did before and just do a Pic chart and I'll tell you the pros and cons here. And this can be for a large group, it can be for a small group. It really is dependent on how, how much time you have. I'd say you could do this in about five to seven minutes in a group of five people. So possible implement, challenge, kill, implement are the things that have high impact and high feasibility to achieve top right now I've seen people make impact this scale and feasibility, this scale and high over here and low over there and vice versa. So make sure when you look at this it makes sense to you and you're explaining that to everybody else with the labels because you could get confused based on how everybody has their stuff on here. So possible implement, challenge, kill. Kill would be, hey, this doesn't have very high impact and it doesn't have very high feasibility. So chances are if we're going with the zombie apocalypse thing, we are not going to be able to survive the night and it's going to take too long anyways. So both of those combined don't make for a very good scene here. And then you have the others. I don't like to have people create a pic chart knowing that they're going to create a Pic chart. And the reason for that is people like their idea to receive the praise of we're going to use that idea and they try to get theirs up here in the implement category. What people don't recognize a lot of times is that all of these ideas have some sort of float. Right. They're not exact. These are all sort of, you know, we, we did thumbs up and thumbs down, right? So these are next to each other on the x axis and they're next to each other on the y axis. So who's to say that this isn't even maybe a little bit over here and this is a little bit down or up? It doesn't matter. Again, it doesn't really matter. Going off of if you, if you saw part one with the zombies. So these have a float instead. I like to make the pic chart after the fact. And the reason for that is, let's say somebody loses and their alarm right over here is in the kill zone. In order for them to win their argument. When you get to discussion based, I've got to convince everybody on the impact alone and then once it's over here, I have to convince everybody again on feasibility to get it up to the different quadrant. So you have to win two different arguments. So this prevents the loudest person in the room from just saying, oh my gosh, we have to swiss family RoBINSON this thing and put alarms in the top right? Because now we're going to know where the zombies are coming from and it's going to save the day. So instead do this after the fact, make sure that they have to win every argument so they can't just move this all the way over here. They have to win the argument between alarms and food for impact. Then they have to win the argument from everybody with gasoline. Hey, did you know that gasoline and fire don't kill zombies? Well, if everybody didn't know that, maybe alarms could be better. Who knows? And you're going to learn that from the person that's been there for 20 minutes versus the person that's been there for 20 years based on having that discussion. That's why I say this tool itself doesn't matter.
It's the discussion that happens after the fact. It does. So cool. You do a pic chart. You have a discussion based on where things are, how they landed. Do you agree with them? I think the most valuable thing that you can do with a chart like this in the end is ask pointed questions specific to individuals. So you go over here and you go, Johnny, do you think gasoline is more or less impactful than food to survive the night? And you have Johnny answer that question specifically and tell you why and how and who and maybe tell us some knowledge that we didn't know so that by the time we're done with this, we know a lot more about the problem set, we know a lot more about the solution set, we know a lot more about each other. And we have buy in to what we're looking at at the end. We could look at it and go, yes, I've got full and total buy in to this thing. For some weird reason, people will remember where their stickies landed days, weeks and even months into the future with a group setting like this. So you'll do it and they will remember, hey, this was in that quadrant. It was next to that. And they could almost recreate it. Okay, a lot of things that you can do with this one.

After: Identifying problems or solutions.","We've already done the zombies. We've already talked about the pic chart. Here's another way to look at how things are prioritized and how you move forward when the group is either potentially not agreeing or how do you come up with your roadmap going forward? So a couple ways of looking at this. I like to do concentric rings and it doesn't matter where they are. You can discuss this. You could say, should the ring come down here and come over, should it be sharp and then over to the side, you kind of let the group decide that. Okay, but for now, I'm just going to show you two rings or two curves in some way, shape or form. This can be the now, soon, later today, tomorrow, next week, next week, next month, next year, whatever it is. We already talked about the way that these float. So these could go in or out of those rings. That's why discussing those rings they're showing up is important to have that discussion. Hey, should we bring it down here? Should we come down, cut this one off, etcetera, and allow the group to kind of fight it out a little bit, but give them a finite amount of time to do it. So let's just say draw your rings, everybody. You have three minutes. Go. This allows them to really get in there and like, they're just going to have to make a decision and put the ring wherever it goes. So I like to look at this in ratios because sometimes it speaks to people in the room for them to kind of understand where these things are, the ratios are. We got a one to two ratio, a one to one ratio, and we've got a two to one ratio, one to two. One is, I'm going to put in this much effort and I'm going to get this much more out of it as a result. Two, one to one, I'm going to put in a lot of effort and I'm going to get out what I put in, one to one ratio, two to one ratio. I'm going to put in so much work and effort, and I'm only going to get out a one in results. Okay, now this is where I like to talk about low hanging fruit, because a lot of people have a different idea of what low hanging fruit really is. And you'll hear people all the time go, oh, that's just low hanging fruit. There's almost always the word just before low hanging fruit. Oh, that's just low hanging fruit. Here's the thing, low hanging fruit. You're hungry, you need something to eat, you can reach it. You don't need a ladder. You don't even have to sweat for it. You reach up and grab it and you take a bite. Low hanging fruit is high impact, high feasibility. So next time anybody ever says, hey, that's just low hanging fruit, say, hey, do you know the real definition of low hanging fruit? Depending on what your personality is, don't get in trouble on my accord, but low hanging fruit. Okay, cool. So we have these ratios. We've described it. Everybody knows where these rings are. That still might not be enough for everyone to go, we're going to start doing this today, we'll start doing this next week, and we'll do this next month or whatever it is.
Right. It might allow you to have a meaningful discussion on why these things are where they are and put them in the right and proper category for your own organization with how you're going to accomplish these things or allocate resources to them, etcetera. So there's another way to look at it. And this is kind of the domino effect, right? This is, it's going to get
messy over here, but follow me. One thing might rely on another thing. To rely on another thing, etcetera. So I'm going to move away from my zombie example and I'm going to give you something. So don't read these as I'm circling them. Just kind of think through this. So if you want to improve culture, okay, you're going to need to improve the communication that you have in your organization to do that. So let's say that, you know, it's very impactful to change culture, right? But it's really hard to do. But let's say something that's really easy to do, maybe up here is communication. You're going to do this first. You're going to improve communication, which is directly going to improve or help you achieve a better culture. So even these are, they're in different rings. They're based on each other. We're going to do this, which is going to allow us to do that. And you might even say if we do that, this thing doesn't have as much impact, but it's going to make that a lot easier. And if we do that, it's definitely going to make this a lot easier to do. And so we're not going to do this in today, tomorrow, next week. Instead, we're going to go number one, two, three, and four. These are the four things that we're going to achieve before next quarter. Again, the zombies didn't matter. The pic chart didn't matter. The grids didn't matter, the floats here didn't matter. In the end, what matters is that the group has a common understanding of what each other thinks about two independent variables, the impact that it has on the organization or the individual or whatever, and the feasibility that those things coming together have for the organization. You combine those two things, that's removing the emotion from the decision making process, which allows you to look at something that is seemingly very messy and actually understand what the heck it means and go, hey, our organization and institution is messy, but we have found a way to kind of look through it and we can articulate what we want to the boss or the directors, or whatever you want to call it, the managers to move the needle. And we need this much resources or time, duration, whatever to solve those things or move the needle forward, etcetera. So change zombies to whatever you'd like. Experiment with this one. Start off really small. Do not get in front of a group of 30 people and try this one for the first time. I promise you, you will mess up, even if you are incredible at what you do. Practice this. Practice this with one person or your cat first so you know how you're going to step through it in a group from start to finish. For all three parts of this, I can bring everybody, 30 people through it in about, we'll say 20 minutes. 25 minutes allows me to go through it personally with the zombies. Get everybody to relax, maybe have a stand snack while I'm doing this and they're voting or like a working lunch at the end of lunch, and then have them take their own ideas that they hopefully did earlier in the workshop, put their own categories up here and rack and stack their own categories.
Have them do all of that in under 20 to 25 minutes easily. There are some other things that we can do with this. It is never ending in my opinion. My favorite prioritization tool right here. Zombies.",whole song and dance,[],,

After: An introduction to the session.","For this exercise, all you need is a sharpie. Sticky notes for everybody. For the masses. You do not need this. This is just for demonstration purposes. You can, however, use a chalkboard, a white board, you know, a sticky note, a piece of paper. It doesn't matter. Just so you can show everybody what you're going to do, everybody is going to think through this exercise kind of the way that, the way that I show you here, but on their sticky note. Okay, so they're all going to draw a triangle, circle at the top and circle at the sides. Okay, this is a user. This user leverages or uses leverages or uses this solution to solve or improve this problem that the user has. Okay, there's a reason that I don't have this pre done beforehand, because it's a lot. If you just say, this user leverages or uses this solution to solve this problem. Cool, you got it. Go do it. Instead. I slow it down. I write it out. Everyone's kind of confused that I'm going slow, and then I kind of dissect it. Okay, everybody is going to do this on their own post it note, and I go ahead and tell them, so what of this exercise, before we even start, so that they're not confused or they at least have some kind of goal in mind of where they're going to go. Right in the end, instead of me going around this room and saying, what do you think our problems are and what do you think potential solutions are and who are we solving this problem for and what's the root cause and et cetera, et cetera. Instead, everyone's going to write one. We're going to share it in about 15 to 20 seconds each. And in the very beginning of this workshop, we're going to have a very good pulse on where everybody is in the room. And here's the so what. Even beyond the so what is, if everybody writes it in the very beginning, you can't really change it. So hearing from Fred or Susan or Catherine, when it gets to Johnny, Johnny has not rewritten his original thoughts based on their thoughts. These are all raw and organic thoughts and problem sets before everybody kind of dives in. So that's why it's so valuable for this pulse.
Right?
So you say start with the user. Are you thinking about yourself? Are you thinking about the organization as a whole? Are you thinking about a specific person within a team, a specific team, a department, et cetera? That is the user. So take the time to think about what you want to get out of today.
Right.
They're going to have some kind of idea of what you're doing for the day leading into this anyways.
Right.
They had emails and invites to be here. Hopefully you've given some kind of introduction. So what is the user for today for you?
Right.
What are they going to leverage? What are they going to use? So this solution that you're coming up with, there is a reason that we write solution and then problem. We don't just say, this user has this problem and they're going to use this solution to solve it. Instead, you start with the solution and it's a mind shift from we've got these problems and, yeah, we're going to solve it. Check out the hook while my dj revolves it. And I'm kidding. Instead you start out of the positive. You say, we've got this solution or, we've got this idea. It doesn't even have to be good. It's just something that improves the user's experience towards this problem. That's why it's a triangle, because you can kind of go backwards. This user has this problem and we use this solution to solve it for the user.
Right.
This is done this way. Just because it's clockwise, it actually makes sense this way. And it starts you off with a positive mindset for the day. Instead of saying, here are our problems, this is our solution. I've said that before. I want to make sure that it's locked in for you, this user. This is the last time this user leverages or uses or whatever word you want to use this solution.
Right.
You're going to write this solution to solve this problem. Everybody writes it. You give everybody. I'd give everybody about three minutes to really think through this. I wouldn't go more than five and I wouldn't go less than three. It's the perfect amount of awkward time where the people that have it right away, they've got it and that's great. And you're not going to waste a lot of their time. The people that don't, you've given them a chance to really do it. You are going to ask everybody to say this out loud. So if you have, I'd say, more than 25, 30 people, I'd recommend breaking up into big groups.
Right.
You split the group, 15 over here, 15 over there, or however many more you have, just because you're going to end up taking a lot of time out of everybody. You do not have to do this for an entire group of people. You can do it in subgroups. So you explore and then they go to the breakout group that they're going to use for the remainder of the day or the exercise or the workshop. And so they get a little bit more of a taste of what each other are thinking before they dive in and kind of get to know each other a little bit more, potentially, depending on where you put this.

Right.
Again, very, very quick way to get the pulse of the room allows you to put these off to the side after the fact so that you can revisit it at the end of the workshop and go, did we solve any of these problems? What were our problems? Did we get to the root cause of what we said in the beginning of this workshop? Were our users the same, or are we off all over the map on what we think we need to do together? This is usually followed by a very meaningful discussion because everyone is going to hear all these things. They can take notes, you can prompt them. Please take notes while you're listening to everybody, so that when the time comes for us to have our discussion, you can, you know, point out key aspects of what people said, the discussion afterwards. The meaningful discussion is very, very powerful and made better by having all of these kind of on the board or in the pockets of everybody to bring out after a break or something like that.

Right? We are. We're crushing it. This idea is going to solve and boil the ocean today. This one is really good and might help us start that process. This one is okay. And maybe we should still talk about it. Anything on the fringes is like, this idea is so bad, it's not even worth opening our mouth to talk about at all, period. Right? And what you can do is you have everybody take their ideas as they're going, or after the fact, it's up to you, and place them where they think they belong. The bigger the bullseye, the more space you have. And here's a cool thing. So let's say a bunch land right here, right in the middle. You can tell them, hey, I only want two to land in the bullseye. So you all have to discuss amongst yourselves where these go. Is this one now going to come out to the fringes? And this one will come out here. Like, how are you going to do that?

many groups as needed.","Concepts from a previous brainstorming activity, a

not so much. This tool provides a simple matrix to allow
for the rapid voting and ranking of opportunities based
on two simple factors: How much impact will this concept
have? How easy is it to get done?",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732382/lectures/39187663 ,"Before: Developing action items After: Brainstorming concepts (problems,
stakeholders, or solutions).","Impact over easy. Exactly what you need in order to prioritize your ideas. It can be used for problems. I prefer to use it on ideas exclusively. What you'll need is a flip chart, a stack full of ideas. Your participants who hopefully created those ideas. It's best done with, well, it can be an unlimited number because you are going to need voting. You're going to need dots, which John will bring me some dots momentarily. So, to get this started, we're actually just going to draw out a simple grid. We're going to have impact on one side and we're going to have ease on the other. As you can see, higher up, meaning the more votes for the idea with our blue sticky, I mean our blue dot sticker, sticker, sticky and sticker. Our blue dot sticker will increase the impact in the red. The more dots of red we have on an idea, the more easy, the easier it will be to complete that idea. So, as you can see, I have a handful of ideas here below on this chart. Our goal is actually just to map out which ideas are both impactful and easy to be completed. This is the sweet spot area. That's where our best ideas will be located. Simple enough. So what you do is draw this map, show all the ideas to make sure all the individuals understand what ideas are available to vote on. Everyone. All individuals can vote on any ideas. I like to give, depending on the number of participants, three to five votes to each individual of each color. That's three to five blue and three to five red. Make sure that's the same exact number for both. So if we were to have, say, make an online course, that could be impactful. But it is not easy. Trust me, I'm doing it right now. Or we could get matching tattoos. That would be easy, maybe. No, it would probably be hard to convince John and it wouldn't be impactful. So that's probably going to be our lowest idea. We could host a meetup that would be relatively easy but not so impactful. We could write a book that's pretty difficult and maybe a little less impactful depending on how well we write it. Or we could do a podcast, which I'd say similar impact, similar ease. In fact, I think it's probably even easier. So when we look at that, we're not completely sold on the top right quadrant is our go to quadrant for what options are the best. So we maybe need to think about according to our business goals, according to this project's goals, which ideal would bring us the most value to tackle first? Even if it's a little difficult, even if it's a little complex. Again, each of these will have votes on them to make it as easy as possible. Blue being impact or value, blue value, kind of easy to remember and ease being red.
An individual can vote, must vote with all their ideas. They must not share what they're voting on, and they can't trade actual dots or stickers so that one person doesn't influence at all. I like to have a rule of thumb that no individual can vote for more than three of a single color on a single post it. In order to explain that it's best to actually show a post it, which I don't have right here. Show a post it with the dots on it so that they'll know where their limits are. You can also keep an eye on everyone, just to make sure no one's trying to skew the vote in one direction or another. So the process is as follows. Get the ideas. Place them in an open space where you're easily able to move them around. Ask everyone to vote next to
the idea. Vote directly next to the idea, not on top of it. If you have a large group of individuals, there can be so many votes on an idea that you can't even read it. This allows you to easily count them and then take that exact post it and move it over to our prioritization grid. I found best practices. You allow the voting of the two different colors and then you write down. So for impact, 14 votes. For ease, we've got seven. So you have that for each idea, and then that makes it easier to actually line out. Some people might be very specific, like John, and need to have the exact measurements laid out so that it's easy to move the ideas in a grid form. This is just a simple, quick way to organize your ideas. Now, if you want to go an extra step, you can always divide up the ideas into, you know, your best bet, which I have terrible handwriting. Your best bet, your, you know, let's get it done soon, or keep focused on it. I like to think of this as the research category. How could we make it easier to do? How could we make it more impactful? And then probably your no go zone. So down here is your no go zone. It doesn't have impact. It's not really going to do anything good for us. So we'll leave those ideas to decide. We might need to research a little bit more, and since it's easiest, we could just pop in and do that one right away. Now, this is called many names the Eisenhower matrix, the impact effort grid, the prioritization grid. You can host it, you can go through it however you like. This is just the steps that I prefer to take so that it is as direct, straightforward and simple as possible. The two colored dots allow for a greater depth of understanding about what we're prioritizing. A lot of times people can get caught up on impact. What does impact mean? So impact just means value to the organization and value to the user. When we say easy, that's the how easy is it going to be for us to get the resources we need to get to the due date on time, to have everything at our fingertips so that we can actually complete the idea? So impact versus ease, that is impact over easy.

After: Generating concepts or ideas.,"Now, if you were ever in middle school in America, you probably played the basketball game knockout where you line up on the free throw line. You have to shoot. The person behind you is shooting as fast as they can behind you. Sorry, I'm left handed. I'll do it right handed too. They're shooting as fast as they can behind you to try and knock you out of the game. In this prioritization exercise, the great, great advantage of it is that you will have a head to head between every idea that you have come up with. So I like to limit the pool of ideas to about eight. Otherwise it can be rather overwhelming. For this exercise, you just need your eight ideas or less ideas, a space to put them. It could be on the wall or it could be on flat on a table, and you line them up in one straight line like shown here. As you go through this, you can do it picking one single individual or asking the entire group. I prefer to ask the entire group. So we'll walk through it. You have all your ideas lined up in a single line on a flat surface. The order at this moment actually doesn't matter, but once we've gone through all the ideas, we will leave with a prioritized list of every idea versus every idea to show one true winner, one champion in the far square, which will be on the far left of whatever flat surface you have. So here are the rules, and I'm going to show you because it can get a little confusing. We'll start off with a head to head of concepts versus idea. When you start off, you're always going to want to start with the first idea on the right. We do that because as we progress through each idea, we'll know that this idea has already been used. So the unused idea on the right is the one we're going to start with. Are you confused yet? I'll keep going. So we'll start with concepts. Concepts will be in a head to head battle with idea. Now, crowd participants, is this idea more important than this concept? Yes or no? Let's discuss it. We'll have 1 minute to make a decision. Who would win in this head to head battle of importance of this idea? Well, it looks like concepts was not a winner. So concepts will stay to the right of the idea. It went head to head with an idea, will then be able to continue on forward. Now, the more ideas you have, the more overwhelming it can get. So I'm going to add a few more ideas so we can kind of walk through what a full round might look like. So concepts lost. We're going to restart the knockout rounds with the next idea in line from the right, which is idea. We're going to drop it below thought. Now, is this or this one more important? Well, it turns out ideas more important.
So, thought we'll go to the right. Idea will then move to left to battle the next idea. So is jacket or idea more important? Ah, looks like jacket's more important in this case. So we'll repeat that process of picking up an idea from the right that has not been discussed yet, battling all the way to the left until they lose, and then returning back to the next idea on the right that hasn't been used. So we'll continuously come back to the beginning. Have we used concepts? Yes. Have we used thought? Yes. Have we used idea? Yes. Which means this would be our final prioritization of jacket, idea, thought, and concepts. This allows you to go through every idea and know, as opposed to voting on a broad number of ideas. This is sort
of voting on just two ideas in a way. It's isolated voting on everything but super focused so that you are able to think of all the factors between what this thought brings to the table and what this concept brings to the table. Now, it does take more time because you're having more conversations watching it in action. It's very simple. One straight line of post its, one idea battling another. If it loses, it stays where it's at. If it wins, it continues progressing forward. This can take between 30 minutes all the way up to over an hour, depending on how many ideas and how in depth the conversations of those head to head knockout rounds go. It's full of conversation. It can get a little heavy if you let it go for longer than 30 minutes. I try and keep the number of participants to under seven just because the number of opinions can become overwhelming in the number of responses so long that you for sure will be in that conference room, that workshop space, for over an hour. That's knockout, and it can definitely hit all the ideas out of the way and leave you with a perfect prioritized list to turn into action items.",prioritization tools,['A head-to-head battle between every idea (top 8 ideas)'],,

After: Brainstormings concepts (problems, stakeholders, or solutions).","Moscow tool drinking your way to priorities Moscow tool is a simple process for prioritizing the different sections of an idea, a specific idea, or overall all the ideas and options you have at hand. Great for doing ideas, not as great for using to identify what problem we should focus on. So definitely use it towards the end of the session. Works best for five to seven participants per flip chart. I'd recommend trying to keep it to that. If you have multiple Moscows going on around the room around the same idea or the same series of ideas, you might get different results. It does provide a good discussion point, but it also can kind of cause chaos and misalignment amongst the entire team. So try and keep this to smaller groups in my experience. Now here's how you do it. Moscow, as you can see, is a simple acronym. Must have, should have, could have, won't have. Now, when we're going to break down the idea, this can help us get action items as well. What you're going to want to do is follow the numbers I have here on the board, starting with must have. Our must haves are skeleton mode. Our must haves are the things that keep the body of our idea in place. They are the base level, the function that we need in order to actually complete the most basic version of the idea. While it's not beautiful, it is able to work and run. So that's why must have cannot be excluded these ideas. Now, if we have multiple ideas already written out, these ideas must be done in order for us to have any progress at all. They must be done first. Anything that has a dependency on it can be done later in a section that we would call should have. So when I say something extra, I mean it's not fundamental for the immediate success or functionality or completion of the idea, but it is needed in order to enhance the idea and make it worthwhile. While this gets the idea up and running, this makes it slightly prettier or slightly easier to use in the third section. The could have third section down here, but it is the last one you will do. Remember, the order is start with the must haves because that's the easiest for everyone to get aligned on and also the most important. Then you can jump to the won't haves, meaning we will not add this into the idea or we will not do this step. That just helps kind of divide the group of ideas a lot faster, a lot simpler than trying to go one by one across it. This process of extremes allows the ideas to kind of be put into two categories, and then from there separated into the four should have and could have definitely take a lot more effort and a lot more time. They can get a little frustrating for some individuals who are leaning in one direction or the other. I think if there's any controversy over an idea and it is going on for a very long time, I tend to leave it one step back. So if we're discussing should it be a must have or should have, which is a very important category, I tend to lean towards the should have. If it isn't exactly fundamental to the official original success of the product project that is at hand, I just try and say, all right, if it's not going to break it, let's leave it in the should have and we'll get to it. Just immediately after we get that base level built up or completed, that part of the project. Now in the won't have. Again, that's the no go. These things can be parked for now. That doesn't mean never will we do them. But at this moment in time, it's not necessary, it's not
impactful to do so. It's just not worthwhile. We're not at that phase where we need to be in order to actually be able to do that.
We don't have the resources, the time, maybe we don't have the know how or the infrastructure set up yet. So all good excuses to tell the participants when you put some of their ideas in the won't have. So I'm going to repeat everything in a quick summary. The Moscow tool is just this simple process for separating either with within an individual idea what we should and shouldn't do, essentially, and the order of operations of how we're going to do it, or if it's a series of ideas, we can separate them. So we know, okay, this year, the projects that we're going to work on, well, we must work on these in order to actually continue towards our business strategy and goal. We should tackle these next because they're going to enhance our initial efforts. And if we have the time and resources, we could have these things done or these projects completed because it would make an even larger impact, kind of snowball effect. And these guys, although there are incredible ideas, we're going to hold off on them for now. And that is the Moscow tool. Simply put, I like to do it towards the end of a workshop, after we've had deep discussions, after we've talked about ideas. You can also do it at the beginning of a fiscal year. If you are thinking about the different projects that you want to tackle throughout the year. At the beginning of a project, if you already have these concepts kind of whittled down, you do want to have a focus. So you do want to have either a problem or a solution that you're trying to tackle to start with.

You've got ideas, but you don't know where to go from there. From there, how do you figure out which one's next? That's when the nuff test will come super handy for you and your participants. Now, it's a simple exercise for prioritizing ideas based on three factors, new, useful, and feasible. That'll spell enough for you. So in order to set up the exercise, you will need a few things. You'll need different colored post its. Simple. You'll also need a handful of ideas that are the core ideas that you're trying to figure out which one needs to actually happen. Right now it's great for breaking down ideas. This isn't to throw out ideas, but it is to see the weak points of specific ideas and the strong points of others. It's simple, it's organized, and it can be done pretty quickly, in about 15 to 20 minutes if you are prepared correctly. As always, I like to do everything in a group of five to seven. That just allows everybody have the opportunity to talk, discuss and share comfortably. If you are in a group that's a bit larger, I would set up two identical maps or flip charts with the tool already drawn on them, with the ideas already written, so that everybody's discussing the same talking points and then comparing and contrasting the two different groups and allowing them to kind of discuss why one has a higher score than another. So, to continue to explain, I have an example to my right. I'm going to go over the categories first and then we'll talk about the idea. So, new newness of the idea means how novel would it be? Has this been done before? Is this a common idea or is it completely original? Useful. Exactly that. How useful is this idea to us and to our user? Both aspects combined into one feasible. Given our resources, given our experience and our knowledge, are we able to actually get this idea done? How complex would it be? So the more feasible, the easier it is to do so we're going to score every one out of ten. So each individual category is a score out of ten, which we total up at the end, as you can see here. I'm going to dive into the example. The idea we have is called shock socks. Socks that are so fluffy that when you walk around like this, they give you a nice static electricity so you can shock whoever you want. Pretty fun idea, right? So how new is that? Well, I've never seen socks that are intentionally designed to give you static electricity, it's probably not a great idea, but it is a new idea. How useful is it? Not very honestly, other than messing around and shocking people, it's an idea that's not useful at all. How feasible is it? Well, because we already know the science of static electricity and because we know certain materials give us more electric vibes, it's actually pretty feasible. So what I like to do to get to these numbers is actually ask the group, okay, how new is this idea?
And get a little discussion going around the idea. If people aren't comfortable with just shouting out a number and trying to land on an agreed upon number, what you can do is have everybody individually write it down, have a space for you to put all those numbers. You could do the median of those numbers, you can average them. You can also just based
on what you see, go with your gut, a gut check and write down a number yourself and slap it up there. After you do that, you put up the number that you've decided based on what everyone has answered and say, hey, does seven sound like the right number? And then see if there's a big reaction. If there's a small reaction, then I would just leave it. If it's a big. Whoa, whoa, whoa. That's not high enough for whoa. That's a way, way higher than I expected. Remove it calmly and say, okay, well, then walk me through why it needs to be a little lower and let's see if we can come to a quick consensus on this. So 15 to 20 minutes can depend on the number of ideas you're trying to break down. I recommend never putting more than five ideas on enough test because visually and mentally it can be a bit overwhelming. You also really should only be focusing in on about three ideas. That's quick, that's easy to decipher and allows for deeper discussions. So I'm going to walk you through the second one. YouTube videos of socks would be the concept. How new is that? Well, everybody's done YouTube videos and I'm sure there's a whole world wide web on the line of sock videos. Useful. Well, it could get us some promotion, it could get some attention. So I'm going to put it at a three because of that. How feasible is it, man, we already got the camera, we already got some socks on our feet. We can do that right now. That's very feasible. So, as you can see, based on the two ideas we've discussed, the shock socks are still the winner at the moment. We know some weak points as far as the YouTube videos if we can figure out a way to make those videos more unique, potentially the value will go up. That's the great thing about this exercise. If you notice one idea that had a lot of potential actually scores low, you can discuss the reasons why it ended up being lower and see if there's a way to enhance it. So the idea itself is continuously iterating. It calls you out on your own bluff, or on your own concept, or on the gap of knowledge you have within a certain sector. The nuff test can be done one more time in 15 to 20 minutes. I like to do it with five to seven participants or a sister team of five to seven participants. That would total up to ten to 14 total within the group. Easy. Everyone just needs to be circled around a visible area where you can show this. You also need to come prepared with a handful of ideas. Whether this is at the end of a workshop and you already have a quick snapshot of, these are the five ideas we're trying to actually break down. Or if you just come to a head to head where you can't figure out of the ideas that you've already prioritized, which one of the two or three ideas you have actually needs to get done.
This is a simple exercise just to decipher between that and also break down into simple categories the value behind each section so you can piece that together into a presentation after the fact. And I guess that's probably enough said for the NUF test.",prioritization tools,['New'],,

After: Sharing ideas or concerns around a topic," Prioritrees. It helps you grow into some priorities. So following a brainstorming exercise, you're going to want to use priorities to organize those initial thoughts. Maybe you did a leaf pile, which is another exercise we have, and just have a big fat stack of wonderful ideas. Now you need to convert them into an organized pattern and figure out which ones are better opportunities than the next. To do that, all you need is a priority. So again, you'll need to have a stack of our a stack of ideas already created before you use this exercise. This is for prioritizing. Now draw on a whiteboard or a flip chart like I have here, a simple tree. So we know the core of the tree will be the most important idea. So put the most important ideas as close to the trunk as possible. And I like to draw three branches to start off. Each branch will represent a category of ideas. Maybe. As you can see here, I've already grouped some of the ideas, but so maybe we have blue, green, and pink. As an, as some ideas, we know those are similar ideas for some reason. Pink is the most important. Green is the least important. I know. Shirt, jacket, shorts. So as you can see, as we go sharing the ideas, we can start to categorize them. The way I prefer to share, because it helps do this in a very organized process, is after everyone has their ideas in that brainstorming session, they hold onto them, and I pick one individual to go through all their ideas. First they share, they pause, they wait to see if anybody has a similar idea, and then they continue on. So you don't want to overwhelm everything by making too many branches either. So try and find maybe four or five branches, common categories of ideas that you can organize in. So the first individual will share through all their post its, placing them on various branches. And if some ideas are a little too crazy, we can say they're just kind of hanging out. Maybe the leaves are falling a little bit, or maybe we put them at the top of the tree for now, until we kind of can boil that down into a more concrete category. Again, the ideas are in order of importance, so the closer to the core trunk, the more important. The farther away, the less important. Allow the individuals to all go up on their own. Start adding those as they add them to the board. In that process of sharing, you'll notice the tree becomes fuller and fuller. A lot of the ideas may be very similar. If the idea is exactly the same, stack one on top of the other. If they're very similar, they'll just go right next to each other we'll notice that the tree becomes more and more full until it may be time to shake the branches a bit. So after everyone shared their ideas, after you have them categorized, one thing you can do is actually write a name of a category. Name the branch so that from a far distance, if your participants are seated, or if you just take a quick snapshot of the photo, everyone has an initial instant understanding of what each branch is talking about. So once you have all those ideas, you can shake the branches by saying, okay, guys, it's time to kind of shake things loose, because this tree is way weighing down. It's got too many leaves.
The branches are going to fall off and won't be able to do anything at all. So let's see, if we shook the tree, which leaves would fall off? Because they're not hanging on, they're not as
intensely important as the rest, right? They're not full of life as the other one. So when we shake the tree, maybe a few post its will fall off and we realize one or two are more important than the rest. We can use this to get a quick snapshot of our own power to prioritized ideas, the categories they fall into and then dive into deeper discussion. This is just, again, kind of a gut check. A quick look at what the prioritization might lay out to be, and then we can move on to break these down into action items, into actual steps to make concrete, tangible results.

prioritization session.","Product box. The perfect way to wrap up a crazy day of workshopping. If you've brainstormed ideas, you have them possibly prioritized. You have five or so, maybe an idea per participant. I like to have an idea for every four participants because here is what they are going to have to do. Group the participants and allow them to select the idea they want to build or simply assign it. Remember, you need to start off with those prioritized ideas. Next, you're going to have to prep a handful of completely white boxes, and you're going to task them with the following. Now imagine if your idea was sold in a department store. We're going to design the packaging that it comes in. It's a simple box that you have to fill out each side in order to actually describe it. So a customer can pick it up, look at it, and learn everything they need to know about it before deciding whether or not they need it. I have made, and because I'm terrible at wrapping, I have made a box here myself. So we're going to start off with the first and most easy, well, the easiest side to do, which is naming of the box and coming up with a slogan. So you will name your idea and come up with a slogan about it. Next, you're going to write the key benefits of that idea. Why is this idea valuable on the other side? Boop. Of course we're going to say how to use it. Are there requirements for using it? Are there requirements on our end for making it? And of course, on the back we've got this definition of the customer type. This can be actually a Persona that you fill out. But who is this product for? Simple, straightforward. If you want to get even farther into conversation, you can ask them to describe what they would fill the box with. That can be the context of the idea itself, the detailed description of the idea. That can be what's inside of it. Easy to do. If there are other factors, like an expiration date, you can put that on top of when the idea or project should be completed. It's a simple, straightforward exercise, which I love, that allows all individuals to get excited, get creative, and really well define their idea. After each group is finished, I like to give them 20 to 30 minutes to really try and decorate this thing as incredible as possible. I'll have colored markers, stickers, everything you can imagine for an intense arts and crafts adventure to build these boxes. Now, the best boxes you can probably find are going to be at your common FedEx store. Walmart has some really cheap options for less than a dollar not to give them a sponsorship, but we haven't given out a sponsorship in a while. A little shout out. So after each group finishes their boxes, maybe 20 to 25 minutes in. I like to give each group two minutes max two and a half minutes to share their ideas. We'll set up like a stage and they'll have a pitch where they describe the box, they tell each side of it, and they walk through what it actually is and how they're going to get it done. After each group goes well, hopefully they'll have fans of their idea.
I allow for an applause session at the end for each idea for voting. Or you can actually do the bucket approach, which is mentioned in another video where you vote by simply dropping your post it into a bucket underneath the idea they like the most. While everyone is sharing.
An interesting extra that you can do for your participants is ask them all to take notes on the ideas, track what they liked about each, and how they could add it onto their own concepts. This is kind of a middle ground of ideas in the process of brainstorming. So you have a defined idea, a defined product, but it allows you to continue enhancing it by stealing from the concepts of others in the room. And since we're all in one organization, building a better overall project, process or product, or maybe even even a person, and that is the product box can be called the cereal game.

After: An introduction to the session.","For this exercise, all you need is a sharpie. Sticky notes for everybody. For the masses. You do not need this. This is just for demonstration purposes. You can, however, use a chalkboard, a white board, you know, a sticky note, a piece of paper. It doesn't matter. Just so you can show everybody what you're going to do, everybody is going to think through this exercise kind of the way that, the way that I show you here, but on their sticky note. Okay, so they're all going to draw a triangle, circle at the top and circle at the sides. Okay, this is a user. This user leverages or uses leverages or uses this solution to solve or improve this problem that the user has. Okay, there's a reason that I don't have this pre done beforehand, because it's a lot. If you just say, this user leverages or uses this solution to solve this problem. Cool, you got it. Go do it. Instead. I slow it down. I write it out. Everyone's kind of confused that I'm going slow, and then I kind of dissect it. Okay, everybody is going to do this on their own post it note, and I go ahead and tell them, so what of this exercise, before we even start, so that they're not confused or they at least have some kind of goal in mind of where they're going to go. Right in the end, instead of me going around this room and saying, what do you think our problems are and what do you think potential solutions are and who are we solving this problem for and what's the root cause and et cetera, et cetera. Instead, everyone's going to write one. We're going to share it in about 15 to 20 seconds each. And in the very beginning of this workshop, we're going to have a very good pulse on where everybody is in the room. And here's the so what. Even beyond the so what is, if everybody writes it in the very beginning, you can't really change it. So hearing from Fred or Susan or Catherine, when it gets to Johnny, Johnny has not rewritten his original thoughts based on their thoughts. These are all raw and organic thoughts and problem sets before everybody kind of dives in. So that's why it's so valuable for this pulse. Right? So you say start with the user. Are you thinking about yourself? Are you thinking about the organization as a whole? Are you thinking about a specific person within a team, a specific team, a department, et cetera? That is the user. So take the time to think about what you want to get out of today. Right. They're going to have some kind of idea of what you're doing for the day leading into this. Anyways, they had emails and invites to be here. Hopefully you've given some kind of introduction.
So what is the user for today for you? Right. What are they going to leverage? What are they going to use? So this solution that you're coming up with, there is a reason that we write solution and then problem. We don't just say, this user has this problem and they're going to use this solution to solve it. Instead, you start with the solution and it's a mind shift from we've got these problems and, yeah, we're going to solve it. Check out the hook while my dj revolves it. And I'm kidding. Instead you start out of the positive. You say, we've got this solution or we've got this idea. It doesn't even have to be good. It's just something that improves the user's experience towards this problem. That's why it's a triangle, because you
can kind of go backwards. This user has this problem and we use this solution to solve it for the user. Right. This is done this way. Just because it's clockwise, it actually makes sense this way. And it starts you off with a positive mindset for the day. Instead of saying, here are our problems, this is our solution. I've said that before. I want to make sure that it's locked in for you, this user. This is the last time this user leverages or uses or whatever word you want to use this solution. Right. You're going to write this solution to solve this problem. Everybody writes it. You give everybody. I'd give everybody about three minutes to really think through this. I wouldn't go more than five and I wouldn't go less than three. It's the perfect amount of awkward time where the people that have it right away, they've got it and that's great. And you're not going to waste a lot of their time. The people that don't, you've given them a chance to really do it. You are going to ask everybody to say this out loud. So if you have, I'd say, more than 25, 30 people, I'd recommend breaking up into big groups. Right. You split the group, 15 over here, 15 over there, or however many more you have, just because you're going to end up taking a lot of time out of everybody. You do not have to do this for an entire group of people. You can do it in subgroups. So you explore and then they go to the breakout group that they're going to use for the remainder of the day or the exercise or the workshop. And so they get a little bit more of a taste of what each other are thinking before they dive in and kind of get to know each other a little bit more, potentially, depending on where you put this.
Right. Again, very, very quick way to get the pulse of the room allows you to put these off to the side after the fact so that you can revisit it at the end of the workshop and go, did we solve any of these problems? What were our problems? Did we get to the root cause of what we said in the beginning of this workshop? Were our users the same, or are we off all over the map on what we think we need to do together? This is usually followed by a very meaningful discussion because everyone is going to hear all these things. They can take notes, you can prompt them. Please take notes while you're listening to everybody, so that when the time comes for us to have our discussion, you can, you know, point out key aspects of what people said, the discussion afterwards. The meaningful discussion is very, very powerful and made better by having all of these kind of on the board or in the pockets of everybody to bring out after a break or something like that.

We've all had someone in the backseat, or been that someone in the backseat asking why, when are we going to be there? How? Who? What questions is what we're going to be asking in this exercise, what you'll need is your group of participants all gathered around one table. Everyone will be given a sharpie, but one individual will be in charge of filling in the chart to my right. They can do it with post its, they can fill it directly on their own. This will help you consolidate all your ideas. Well, hopefully by now you've got one concrete idea, but it'll help you build out that idea so that you're able to describe it to individuals that are not attending this session. Or it's a great sheet for yourself, so that when you revisit what you did in the workshop, you'll actually be able to easily remember, recall what you discussed. So this is called curious questions, or in Spain, it's called mapa de innocencia, the map of innocence. All we're going to do is ask a lot of questions. So starting with what? What is the idea that we're discussing? What is the idea or topic we're discussing? Why? Why is it important? Why does it exist? Why is it valuable? How? How is it going to be used? How do we use it? How do we plan on executing? Who is it for? Who's going to be interacting with it? Where that can be, where are we going to offer this service or product? It can also be, where do we plan to get this work done and when? That's our time schedule. So at the end of this simple exercise, which I know, I say the exercises are simple a lot, because our goal is to make conversations as simple as possible. Your team should have walked through with one single idea. Remember, one idea focused only what it is, why it's valuable, how are we going to execute it? How does it work? Who is it for? Who do we need to get involved with it? Where are we going to execute the idea? Whether that is online, offline, in a digital state? Right?
When? When is it due? So an example of this idea could be we're going to open up or we're going to create the shock socks that was mentioned in a previous episode. Remember, shock socks are little socks that you can walk around in. They give you static electricity so you can shock, maybe your siblings or possibly your best friends in a fun game of sock. Shocking now. So the shock socks, which is difficult for me to say, what are they? I just described them. Why? Well, because it's a fun pastime for individuals and it can be energizing. How? How do the socks work and how do we plan on getting them manufactured? Who, who is it for? Who would be the actual user of this product? And who else do we need to get involved to make this reality? Where, where are we getting it built? Where are we selling it? What are our channels that we hope to distribute it from? And when, when do we hope to get to market? When do we hope to have a prototype of the product? When are we going to schedule our next meeting? So it's a very free flowing series of questions that get you clarity as you go through each step. That is curious questions. And remember the importance of
asking. Ask as many questions as possible to get as much information as possible. This limits us to a flip chart, so we can't get completely overwhelming. A big bonus of it. I like to do this exercise in about ten to 15 minutes with four to five individuals. I like to make it a little more tight knit so that conversations can vary, go deeper, allow for more free flowing ideas. And that is curious questions.

What I have next to me is the full, done up deeper meaning. I'm going to give you an example. I'm going to tell you how many participants and how to do it. The materials you need, post its flip chart and sharpies. I like to do this, as always, in groups of five to seven. I've personally ran this exercise with as many as 70 participants, so it's not a problem to have more. It is best to divide them up into little groups so that they can have deeper discussions about the deeper meaning. So I'm going to show you how to set it up, and then I'm going to tell you a story about how I used it. So maybe you can relate and expand on it for your own purposes. So all you have to do is write topic big at the top. Why does it exist today? Right? So why does it exist today means what is the actual deeper meaning? Not just what it does, but the deeper meaning, the values of why it exists today. So the example I like to use is during a workshop which makes engineers, computer engineers with fashion designers. Our goal was to figure out the future of fashion and how to blend technology into actual functionality of fashion. So the first place we started was actually by breaking down. Well, why do clothes even exist? So we put clothes at the top and then we asked ourselves, why do clothes exist today? Now, some of the things that would come up in the conversation were around identity, whether that was social or cultural. I wear my clothes because it is my identity. It represents who I am, it represents the culture I come from or the social environment I am a part of. Maybe it was about function, meaning it was an actual functionality to it, like a swimsuit for swimming, or a fuzzy jacket for warmth, or really light, breathable clothing for fitness. Or it could have been for protection. When we think of shoes or even the jackets we wear, maybe it's to protect us from sunlight. Maybe it's to protect us from, like, police officers wear a bulletproof jacket. Maybe it's to protect us from a variety of situations. So, identity security, function functions, a broad category. So ask them to boil it down a little bit more. What we were able to do with this, and what I like to do when I use this exercise, is to pick a single value. We'll call them values for right now. So if we picked security, that would be our focus for the next step of brainstorming and one of the core values of the final solution we were going to put forward. So when we think about fashion, we think about security. We can find ourselves thinking of various situations. So when you partner a value with a user, then you're able to really effectively create a solution. So I'm going to partner a value with the user. So security, when I think of security and we think of the user of a child near a lake, so how could clothing make them more secure? So a child near a lake, they could get lost. If there's a lake, there's water.
Maybe they don't know how to swim. So I'll focus on that. So maybe we make a swimsuit that upon entering water, the pants actually inflate and provide a life saving jacket, a flotation device that easily keeps the child buoyant and make sure that their parents know that something's happened. So maybe it has a little button in it that goes off too. Whenever
they fall in the water, it alerts the parents on their phones. Now, I'm just brainstorming here off the top of my head. So just by picking a single value of the grander topic of clothes and a user, I was able to generate a very specific idea for a specific scenario that could be completely innovative. Now, you can do this on your own with your group, focusing in on any topic. I like it to be as broad as possible at the beginning. So if you are focusing in on, say, merging technology and fashion, we weren't focused on technology or fashion, we were focused on clothes. So the base level of the whole topic or the area you are focusing on, I like to call this exercise deeper meaning. Some people call it value. Finding the intention behind it is in order to build up ideas, the first thing we should do is break down the existing understanding of the area we are focusing on. So once you get down to that base level, the values of what is an orange for? Right. So what is a fruit provide? Maybe it's just sustenance, maybe it's smell, maybe it's identity. Right. Break it down to the most fundamental definition of it, all the values, and then start building up value by value. You can add in one and another on top of each other as well. So do this. Each group should have their own five to seven individuals in a group. I found this extremely useful at the beginning of any session. Once we're trying to start building up. So the divergent side where we are creating opportunities, creating concepts, when we need a longer list of options. This is a great foundational point that we can come back to and use as inspiration. You may go through security and one user at one point, but then you might focus on identity and another user and continuously generate more and more options until maybe you're overwhelmed and you need to move on to some of the prioritization tips we have in other tools. This is deeper meaning it should take you, depending on the depth of conversation, I'd say 20 to 30 minutes to complete. Any more than that and you're probably stuck in the mud and you'll want to move forward. Prioritize. Pick one of the values. Pick. Take one of your users that you are focusing on for the problem, for the session and go wild. So to continue on some really cool examples of what can come from this, I'm going to go back to the world of fashion in our two and a half, three hour workshop. Here are some of the interesting ideas we were able to create by focusing on a value and focusing on a user. Now, I did ask them to come up with extreme users. So the users were not your everyday run of the mill individual. They were very extreme. So some of the inventions that we came up with in that session were a bra that could help detect breast cancer early on, a jacket to help people on the spectrum of autism to actually communicate their emotions so that doctors could understand them better upon kind of diving into analyzing what might be wrong with them physically or emotionally while they're at the hospital. The next idea, which I thought was pretty cool as well, were sneakers that actually helped, not airplanes.
I dont know if you can hear it, but its pretty loud. But the sneakers themselves were for people that were visually impaired and needed help seeing. The sneakers used some type of sonar technology to bounce off the walls and actually light up the path forward that they needed to go in and gave them some directions as to, hey, youre getting so close to the wall, you might want to stop. Gave them some simple cues that werent out loud so that they didn't feel like they needed to lean on others, that they could do everything on their own. So all the inventions that we created in that two and a half hour session, I got to actually

physically see them built and tested, and they all focus on an extreme user of value that we broke down in the first step of the session and then trying to help an individual improve their lives and empower them in any situation. So never doubt that starting with something simple, breaking it down to the core value won't get you even farther than you could have imagined. Powerful stuff for a simple session. And that's why I call it deeper meaning too. I guess deeper meaning should be serious. So deeper meaning?",problem finding,['It’s all about breaking down to build up'],,

This one is to get the crazy into the actionable and tangible by putting things in groups so that you can kind of wrap your mind around what the group is thinking together collectively. Right. I'm going to go through a very simple explanation and then I'm going to kind of dive a little bit deeper into this one.
Okay.
So you're going to come up with a ton of ideas. So we'll call that divergent thought.
Right.
We're going to come up with a ton of stuff. Right. So we've got some horses on here. We've got idea, thought, concepts, green jacket, whatever. It doesn't really matter. Bunch of ideas.
Okay.
You're going to have the very first person come up to the board, create some white space for them. And what they're going to do is they're going to grab an idea that they did not create themselves. So something that wasn't on their post it note or their handwriting, et cetera, randomly grab it. There's no time to sit here and read them all and decide which one they're literally going to grab. One first person is the easiest. They're going to look at it and place it down on the blank side.
Easy.
Second person comes up and imagine you've got a line of people. So they're going quick. Second person comes up, they go, hmm, this one and that one. Are they the same? No. So they put it over here on its own. Here's the thing. They're not talking. They're not saying, is it the same or not? They're having this internal monologue of, is this the same as that? You can play music for this one. I like to play music and I like to speed things up. Go, go, go. Because you'll understand in a little bit that getting through this will be fine tuned as you go forward by other people helping out. Okay, so the third person comes up, internal monologue. Is this the same as that? No. Is it the same as that? No. I'm gonna create another group over here.
Okay.
So it's a third group. Another person comes up, is this the same? Blah, blah, blah. They go, I
think it's the same as that. Now, it's not. Just so, you know, horse and concepts are not the same. Not that you would ever know that, but they're not. So the next person comes up, they look through, they read it, they place it down here, and then they see concepts over here because they're looking at the board and they go, hmm, I think this belongs over here. So yes, they brought one over, but they also moved one, which is okay, next person, next person, next person, so on, so forth, until, you know, all the horses are together, all this stuff, they're grouped in these clusters, in these groups. Right now, let's say somebody moved concepts from here and the person that originally put it there comes back up and sees that their thing was moved. They go, what the heck? Internally, right? Because they're not allowed to talk. Music playing they might grab it and put it back. The thing is, as you go, certain categories haven't been created yet. Certain commonalities and similarities haven't even been done. So they might have a new idea of where that goes, or they might really think it belongs where it was before and they can move it. My rule of thumb is if something has been moved more than twice, so you're about to move it a third, 3rd time, put it at the very, very, very bottom of the board. And this is where we're going to have a discussion about where it goes, when we're allowed to talk. But for right now, everything gets put in magically where it belongs. Maybe there's a couple things down here that we'll discuss.
Okay.
Still at this point in time, you think you're done and maybe you are, you move on into naming. Well, how are you going to name it if you can't talk? Everybody takes out their sticky pad and they write what they think the commonality is of this thing. So I'll give you some examples. Somebody writes, these are all horses and they put it right here, but they're not allowed to talk. So they just wrote it and put it there. And maybe to make it very clear, they circle it. So imagine a ton of ideas going into groups and categories. You circle the different categories so that you can see that they're on their own. And you circle your own title or underline it or something like that. So everybody understands what you named it. Somebody goes, ah, you know, I don't think it should be called these are all horses. I think these are all stallions. They put that over top of what you did. Again, they circle it, underline it, etcetera, until people stop putting titles over other people's titles. If you end up having to rewrite a same title again to put it over somebody else's, grab the entire stack and table it so that you can have a discussion about it. The purpose of this is these are going to get named very, very quickly by everybody. It's going to create some kind of buy in for what it's called where it belongs, et cetera, et cetera, for what you got. So that moving forward, everybody has the same language, etcetera. In my experience, about 92.1% of the time, everything gets racked and stacked the way that it needs to go in the category that it belongs to. There's very few things that are down here, and there are very few titles that have been tabled. You tell everybody in groups, let's call this group of five to seven. You don't really want to do this for a massive group, although I will come back to that, and you can. I'll just explain that in a minute. They'll all be done, they'll all be named, and you'll be able to move on. You tell the groups once you think that you've gotten too far, as far as you can without talking, you can begin to speak. So you're going to start hearing some groups. So say you have 30 people in

your workshop. You're going to have. This group's begun speaking. They started talking. This one hasn't yet because they haven't made it to this point. You should be able to do this entire thing. Five to seven people will say 75 ideas. You can be able to do the entire thing in under five minutes fast, super, super fast. This does not take all day. You're not sitting here reading and moving, reading and moving for everything. You're doing one thing at a time. And as you get moving, the second and third wave, you'll start to understand where they start lying, where the groups start forming, and you'll more easily be able to choose where everything goes. Now, before you start talking, you can tell everybody, okay, we're going to have five minutes of silence for you to pick out things in here, try to move them from the categories that they're in unless they truly belong there.
And you'll find some people might start to create their own, even though you told them no talking and no writing, et cetera. They might draw a line over to a subcategory of these and start putting some stickies down. People will start doing whatever they do, and it'll allow everybody to really understand what's in all these groups and categories beforehand before they have this discussion. Finally, the reason that this is so powerful is, have you ever been in a group before where the boss or the manager or somebody says, we have four pillars of what we do here, and they are x, y, z, elemental, p?
Right?
You got four things. Well, people can't come up with ideas outside of those pillars. You've put a left and right limit on what your mission vision values are by having these four points instead. If you come up with hundred, 200 ideas of what you stand for, what your mission, vision and values are, first you do an affinity diagram of where they belong and you name them. You might find that you don't have four. You might actually have six or five or seven different categories that everything falls into, and it's more fine tuned into what you're trying to achieve. Affinity diagram can be done super quick, and I said I'd actually get back to you about the large group of people doing this. So finally, finally, large group of people can do this. However, doing those finer moves where you have everybody read things and rename them and whatnot, that gets very cumbersome. It takes a lot of time, but doing the grouping itself, I think the most I've ever done is about 300, 400 ideas, 350 on a board. Had a group of about almost 40 people come up to the board. Affinitize it super, super quick. I'd say about six minutes. Six minutes for that group of people. What you're going to find in that case is some of the groups will be doubled up. Somebody will have created a group over here that is almost identical to a group over here, and all you got to do is combine them. That's it.
It's easy.
So this is affinity diagram. There's a lot of different ways to do it. You can potentially talk, you can name them together collectively as a group. You can vote on things as you move on. There's a lot of stuff that you can do moving forward from this point, but this is the start.

They're still extremely useful. Don't knock it, you might just love it. Now, before you start an empathy map, you are going to need an individual to focus on. I like to use a Persona, just a basic Persona as a precursor. You can just focus on a single individual or user, pick them, focus on them and then walk through the empathy map. You are going to need post its. Everyone is going to need post its. Everyone is going to need sharpies. Again. Five to seven is the best number. Any less than three you are kind of struggling. If you do have the individual who is the user there, it will turn more into an interview. So be wary. Heres how you do it. Now, the setup is pretty simple. Youre going to want to draw this quadrant with a beautiful, somewhat creepy face right in the middle. This will be our user. You can name him, you can label him. If you have or her a Persona already created, simply use that as the basis. You can paste it right in the middle. You're going to want to start with sees and then move to says does. And heres the empathy map is used in order to help us develop a deeper understanding, an empathy kind of a relationship with the individual and their life outside of just the problems we're trying to tackle. But everything they're doing, everything they're thinking, the world they see, it helps us walk a mile in their shoes, as they say. Now, it is simple. It does seem obvious a lot of the time, but common sense can be uncommon and that's where the empathy map is extremely, extremely helpful. So I'm going to walk you through the key questions to ask. Now, a lot of these questions you can find in the empathy map 2.0 from gamestorming. They are incredible. Go to their website. Definitely want to pump them up because it's an excellent resource for any facilitator or workshopper. Now, let's dive into the empathy map. So first you're going to ask the group to take two to three minutes to individually respond to cs, focusing on this user. What do they see from customers, competitors, coworkers? What do they see happening in the industry? Get everyone to write down as many responses as they can to those prompts, only focusing on cs after that. Now, there's two things you can do. You can go through the whole map, but you'll get buried in post its. What I like to do is go through CS and then ask everybody to stand up and come share again.
We try and cluster similar ideas to help us identify common themes or patterns. If you are next level, circle those common themes and patterns and give them a label that helps all your participants be able to recognize from a distance. What are the things that are reoccurring on this, and what are the ideas that we kind of had laid out? Makes it simple from a bit of a distance. So, cs next we move on to SEZ. What does that individual. I like to have them as quotes here. Encourage everybody to write quotes of things they imagine this individual saying, or they've actually heard the user speak them themselves. Again, same process, two to three minutes. Write down as many as possible. Everyone gets up, shares their quotes, grouping similar ones. Moving on to the next. Does. Does is actually the doing the behaviors, the actions that this user is taking throughout the experience we're focusing
on now. We can imagine if it's a customer at a coffee shop, what are they doing? Who are they interacting with? What are the actual physical, mental actions they must take in order to go through the experience, from walking in the door or even getting there to leaving a happy customer? And finally, what we're going to do is hears. Now, here's and says, sometimes people struggle with recognizing the difference. So I like to say, what has this individual heard from friends? What has this individual heard from colleagues? So, as opposed to quoting the user directly, we're going to quote their friends or come up with thoughts that their friends or colleagues might be pointing out to them. It could be shortcomings, it could be positive things. We're just going to try and get everything out on the table using this empathy mat. From there, you've walked in their shoes. You know the user so well, you could probably high five them. It feels like they're right there in the room with you. You can move directly onto the exercise called pain reign, which essentially is writing down all the problems this user is having, trying to get done what they need to get done. Simple, straightforward, immersive. The best thing you can do is have individuals in the room that have experience with that individual. The worst thing you can do is have a group of people that have no context as to what the life of this user is. Just guessing, filling in what that experience might look like. What you're going to get is 100% gut and no data, no real information to inform it. So make sure you have something behind your user. Make sure you know your user well. Make sure everyone in the room understands them, so that when you do this, you can highlight the core issues, the core patterns, and be able to build the best solution possible for that individual. And that is empathy mapping.",problem finding,"[""Walking a mile in someone else's shoes has never been\nmore effective""]",,

No, by bringing in the good and avoiding the bad, of course. In this exercise, we do a simple prompt, positive and negative, to help the group identify the moments that we need to focus on moving towards and the bad things that we need to kind of watch out for on our path towards achieving a goal. So, as a preface to this exercise, you are going to need to define a goal as a group. I have that written up here in the top left corner. When you do have that goal defined, it could be a product you're trying to build, a project you're trying to complete. It can be just that broad. In this project, we're trying to build a new database for our entire organization. In this project, we are trying to paint murals all over the city. It can be that broad. It doesn't have to be concrete. Solid. Okay, now, from there, you're going to want to give everybody post its and sharpies, and you're going to want to write it's perfect and it's a disaster somewhere on a whiteboard or a flip chart. Now, individually, you're going to have each participant brainstorm as many thoughts as they can for three minutes around the following. Now, wait. Before we get started, we do want to remember we're in the future. And to help us live in the future, what I like to do is bring all my participants a pair of these super secret high tech glasses. Now, these glasses were made by I can't say whose technology, but a government department's technology with the help of IBM, to help you actually see the future. And there are some options. You can see the ideal future, and you can see the worst future possible. So to do that, what I like to do is actually bust out the glasses, these wonderful guys. Now that everybody has their glasses of the future on, now that we've gotten our selfies out of the way, what I would like us to do is respond individually in three minutes with as many ideas as possible to this first question. In three years time, we've achieved this goal. Every single thing we set out to do has gone perfectly. We are a mega success. I mean, everything we touch has turned to gold. Nothing has gone wrong in this project whatsoever. What I'd like you all to do as participants is, what did we do right in order to get there? At this point, you let everybody brainstorm for three minutes, silently turn on the music, jam out at the end of three minutes, have everybody get up or everybody share their ideas about what did we do right to make everything go perfectly. I've got some examples. Thinking of kind of that building a database for your company. It's just a random example. They said. We did weekly status reports. We had a blended team of people from different departments. We actually solved the correct problem so we didn't get distracted. We knew the scope of the project, and we hired enough people to have the resources to get it done. Based on that, you can also see that those are probably common problems that popped up in past projects.
A lot of p words there. This just highlights where we need to focus our energy to make sure these things are happening to us. These are things we desire. So we got to keep focused throughout the whole project on these little milestones. Now, pause. Let everybody sit back
down, and we're going to brainstorm another scenario. In this case, it's the disaster scenario. In three years time, we did not achieve our goal. Everything fell apart. Literally everything we did was the wrong decision made. We could not have done worse overall on the project. What did we do wrong in order to get in that situation? Give everybody three minutes time to respond individually, come up with as many ideas as possible. One subtle thing I like to do is usually I like to have maybe a blue or green at the top and a pink or an orange at the bottom. The color difference really helps when you're sitting a bit farther away to recognize the good and the bad. And it also has some little triggers mentally that go along with it. So after everybody stands up and individually shares again, what we're going to do is look at the ideas. It's great to be able to cluster similar ideas. Those are kind of bigger fears that we have about this particular project. The great thing about beginning in the future and looking backwards is it really helps provide a clarity of the description and the ideas that are put up on the board. So here's some of the examples of why the disaster happens. We had too many other projects, and we actually couldn't focus our effort on this specific project. That can lead to a whole nother conversation about diving into what are the priorities of our organization. Bad design. We actually didn't put a focus on making it easy to use or what we created didn't even solve the problem at all. Maybe we did no research. So the problem we tried to solve didn't exactly solve the problem at hands, or we operated in silos isolated from one another. So that lack of communication created a lack of efficiency, which made us just not get to the due date on time. These are all various scenarios that could be applied to the example I started with, or to maybe the situation you find yourself in now. I love to do this at the beginning of any project. It's a great tool for aligning your team on a single goal, but also on the milestones that we want to focus on, the things that we want to drive towards, and also the scary, hairy things that we want to avoid. We don't want any monsters in our closet. It's best that we can see them out in the light. In this exercise, you can complete the whole process within 40 minutes, depending on how deep of a discussion you go to. As always, I recommend five to seven participants per group. If you do have more than that, you can divide up, but you will have to do a playback or a pause to share what each group has uncovered. Now, I like to do that time boxing the individual sharing to a minute, a minute and a half to share what their insights were to the other group or a story time, and then allow everyone to have the full context so that when they go back to their groups, maybe they have an internal discussion and maybe that cross contamination helps provide a better result. So this was future focus. And I know the glasses are silly, but they are intentional because it creates a great environment for sharing openly amongst participants. So go the extra mile, go to dollar tree, get some glasses.
But whatever you do, make sure you use this tool at the beginning of your project. Don't wait until it's too late.

In this simple exercise, we're going to talk about mood boards. Now, it is pulled from the fashion world, so if you have a background in fashion and design, you'll probably be familiar with this process. In order to complete it in the most fun way, in my opinion, you're going to need a printer, possibly a stack of magazines. Five participants, four would be okay. Five per group is what I find to be best practice and a simple problem to be solved. Now, once you have your problem written out that you're going to try and tackle basic, straightforward, you're going to ask the group to get on their computers and find solutions that exist in the world to that particular problem and print them off. Now, let's make this a little more concrete. So say you're trying to build a new company website, sit down with the group and encourage everybody to go online and find from the competitors what they have to offer. Now, that doesn't necessarily mean that we're going to steal like an artist and take all their ideas, but we are going to get a broad landscape of what others have already thought of. So in this particular scenario, we'd get everyone to go online. After we generate a big list of the competitors or people that we aspire to be like, that inspire us, we print off what their home website would look like, what their options for services contact us, even. What's the fun videos they have laid out. We print all that out and put them all on one single wall together. Now, as we go placing them on the wall, we're going to start. Instead of keeping the images in groups according to where they came from, we're going to group them according to similarities between the broader number of photos. So at the end of the day, what we're going to have is a grouping of patterns that we find among our competitors, among the people we aspire to be like. We can recognize those general themes as maybe points that we can touch on and put in our own flavor. So a mood board is just a simple process of grouping together images to identify patterns. Although your intention at the beginning is to get as many images as possible, in the end, you're going to focus on a few core patterns. In the world of fashion, what they might do is go out. Let's say we're looking at Ralph Lauren, Polo. We're going to look at all their competitors, like Brooks brothers, like Izad. I don't wear those type of clothes, so I'm just throwing those out. Now you're gonna look at their competitors get every single image they have on their website out. And then at the end of the day, you might have a thousand different photos which you begin grouping according to the cut of the shirt, the color of the shirt, the actual model, and what they look like. Are they trying to offer to younger individuals that have younger models or older or broad shouldered, stronger models or thinner? Or also look at the backgrounds of where the models are, and you can tie everything into, identify core themes, core patterns, and then build upon them. That doesn't mean you have to include what you're selling or what the solution you're trying to build. You don't have to include every single point, but they do serve as incredible northern lights, being able to recognize those commonalities between everything. And that's what the mood board is about. One visual location. It's very key. One location where you can see everything, the whole
environment of the industry or the whole environment of the solution that we're trying to solve. Simple, as always, straightforward. Keep your groups to five people per group and try and give them at least an hour. This is a deep dive into pulling information. An hour to pull information. 20 to 30 minutes.
Actually group it and discuss it. What you get after, you can create a simple after action report. You can highlight the themes. You can draw the values, the core values, the core colors, the core features of whatever you found, and one up them in your own product.

If you put people under pressure, it can be done even faster. But if you're trying to base it on facts and not fiction, I recommend giving them a little more time. So the Persona is used at the beginning because we're going to focus on a single individual that is our ideal consumer of whatever we are pitching. That could be a product, an idea. It could be the person who's suffering the problem we're hoping to solve. So thinking of that Persona, that first person in line that we're trying to help, the one really, really frustrated with whatever problem we've run into or whatever context, we're going to start with this individual and we're going to build from there. The Persona has a handful of parts. You're going to add a name and a drawing. I don't have a drawing. Here. You're going to list out some of their common behaviors, demographics, about their backgrounds, and some of the needs and goals they have. Again, this will be kind of like your mascot. So the team will all have a common person that they can say, well, would Phil actually like that part of the idea? Would that actually help Phil with his problem? So I'm going to dive in fully to the example. So the idea we have behind this is Phil. Phil is a college student. As you can see, he's from Virginia beach. He's single, he's a sophomore, he's 20 years old. He's a part time dog walker. Now, Phil, his behaviors. He eats a peanut butter and jelly sandwich every single day of the week. He loves them ever since he was a kid, and he oftentimes has to use the change in his car to get his groceries. So we know he's tight on money. We know for some reason he really loves peanut butter sandwiches. We know he's a college student, so we can already kind of paint the picture. The deeper in detail you dive on the Persona, the better it is for the entire team.
By painting it as real as possible, our ideas and our perspective will be enhanced. We will kind of embody the role of Phil as we are creating our ideas. It narrows this down at the very beginning so that from there we can expand onto ideas that are from that individual's perspective, as opposed to just throwing out ideas and then trying to glue one to the needs of Phil. We're actually starting with the needs of Phil and then building the ideas from there. So needs and goals. You can see he doesn't want to be homesick at all, which is why he eats
peanut butter jelly sandwiches, because they remind him of home. He needs to get the most out of his money, and he really wants to have enough money to go to all you, you can eat wing night on Thursday. Thursday. So this is a simple Persona. Let's figure out how we can actually apply this into our own activities. So if you're on a sales team and you're trying to identify the common customer types that you run into, so that a new sales individual, when they're onboarding, can simply read through the different Personas and then actually know how to handle the different objections, the common pain points, and actually be functional as fast as possible. Now, if you are creating a marketing campaign, you can use the Persona to highlight the individual that is most commonly going to use your product, so that the team can brainstorm ideas that would attract that customer as easily as possible. Now, if you are just a facilitator managing workshops, you can use Personas in order to effectively know who's going to show up in the room. In our series, don't take it personally. We dive into all the different Personas you may run into. You can make it your own, make it your way. I personally have used it for a variety of situations. I like it at the beginning of the workshop so that we are all aligned on who is the person that is suffering the most from this problem at hands. And then from there, we can ideate ways of how can we help them, how can we improve their daily life? And that's Persona. Simple exercise, quick and easy, can be done depending on how much pressure you put in ten to 15 minutes. If you really want to deep dive, give the group 20 to 25 minutes to share and discuss.",problem finding,"['While each human is different, we tend to follow certain patterns']",,
Mario v Wario,,3-7 participants per group.,,30-50 minutes,"What is it? Classics from the Nintendo game “Super Mario”, this tool builds upon Persona Please. Using two personas, we widen our scope of focus to uncover a greater depth of context and understanding around a given problem. Materials: Persona Please template (1 per group), Post-its & Sharpies for each participant.

Two classics of the Nintendo game, mario who were enemies against each other. In this process, we're actually going to have two different Personas. So remember, Phil, if you haven't watched the Persona exercise yet, dive into that one first, because this one will build upon it. The Persona. Right. It helps us identify our target user. In this case, we're going to identify two different users. We're going to identify the first in line to use this idea or the first person that this will be most helpful to. And then second, we're going to do the person who's on the fence about using this idea. So Mario will be our first in line, and Wario will be the one on the fence that we probably have to do a little more convincing to actually bring out to use our product. So here's why we do that, and here's what you need. You need two teams. Now, teams just need more than three people. We like to put a ceiling at seven. So three to seven people per team. Assign one to be a wario, the person on the fence, and one to be a Mario, and then allow them to define their Persona based on whether or not that's the ideal customer or a customer that we're trying to bring over to our side. Right. Great examples of that could be the ideal customer for a chocolate chip cookie. I love using chocolate chip cookies as my example, so maybe I would be the ideal customer. I like to eat chocolate chip cookies every night after dinner. They remind me of home. They remind me of my mom and her cooking. So they could target me, an individual who is somewhat healthy, somewhat healthy food conscious, but willing to separate from my diet for a little wholesome goodness once or I say once a week. That's a lie. Maybe three times a week. It could be an extreme user, even more than me, someone who eats cookies every single day. Maybe that's not as healthy. Or it could be someone who's on the fence. When we think of someone who is very health conscious, who might cheat from their diet once a month, who cannot eat gluten, who only eats sugar free in their diet, how would we offer our product to them? How would we offer our cookie idea to them? And do we need to change some of the things in our product in order to get them on our side? We can also do that without changing our own product. We can just change the way we offer it to the client as well. So maybe we just try and get in the cycle of when their cheat day is. Or we hype up the fact that they have this cheat day, and if they want it to be the best one ever, this is what they do. So that's the Wario Mario type game again. You set it up in two different groups. You let them go through the full exercise of a Persona, followed by an empathy map, followed by brainstorming the potential ways we can draw them in, or the potential ways we can enhance or alter our initial idea to fit their needs a lot better. At the end of the day, you walk away with incredible perspectives from both where we normally would go, our target market, and someone who needs a little bit of help to get on our side.
You share with the two groups. I love to make it a prototype where they actually physically build an experience, whether it's with Legos and play Doh or cardboard. But walk through the experience and tell us the story of what that Wario individual's experience would be like
with our offering or idea versus the Mario. Simply done. It should take, if you go through the Personas and the empathy map, plus a brainstorming, about an hour and 20 minutes. But that's an entire workshop. If you just want to identify the Wario and the Mario, that whole process can take ten to 15 minutes per group, plus about five to seven minutes of sharing back. So for the exercise, you will need post its sharpies, two flip charts, and two Persona grids already prepared, drawn out, not filled in, and that is Mario versus Wario.",problem finding,"['Classics from the Nintendo game “Super Mario”, this tool builds upon Persona Please']",,

After: Identifying the key problem",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732362/lectures/39187370,,"Rapid research, you've already identified the problem and now you're desperately in the hunt for solutions, an exciting place to be. Now, in most of the workshops you might discourage individuals from having their cell phones or laptops out. In this particular exercise, we want everyone to have their cell phone, their laptop, whatever source they can have to get information off the Internet so they can pick and choose the greatest ideas that exist already, that people have already tried, that people have already put out there today. Now with rapid research, what we really need is each individual to have a stack of post its, each individual to have their sharpie, and then of course a space to put all the ideas. Now each individual will hold onto all their ideas until the 15 minutes of rapid research is up. They can also write on white a one paper. But I like to have post its because they're colorful and they're smaller, so the ideas aren't as overwhelming or an individual isn't tempted to write as much. So here's how you do it. You take a single problem, a concrete problem. So say you're working in sales. Maybe you're trying to figure out the tiers of gifts you give to prospects or potential clients. That can be a difficult one. Or maybe your company that has a car lot that actually has indoor cars. You can't find them when someone moves them because gps won't work inside. Now you have to figure out how can you track an object indoors at scale, at an affordable price. Pretty overwhelming problems compared to just buying gifts. What you can do with your group, you have the problem identified. You ask each individual to silently bust out their cell phone thinking of the problem. Try and find other examples of what people have used to solve that particular problem. So when we think of tiered gifts for sales, maybe what we're offering has a clever name. So we're going to look up ways to give gifts that make reference to that name. Maybe Coca Cola has done a really cool consumer facing gift project. Maybe we can personalize every individual gift and maybe someone is out there already doing it. Now, what you do as the facilitator is simple. Just say you have 15 minutes to go out and find the most amazing examples of solutions to this problem that exists in the world today. Allow them to use their cell phone and their laptop. Try and encourage them to find as many as possible. And then afterwards, we're going to have a presentation session, a sharing session. In story time, we're going to let all the individuals, which means if this has more than ten participants, they'll just pick one idea if you have less than ten. I found it is reasonable for individuals to share two of their best ideas or findings from their rapid research with the entire group in about a minute and a half to two minutes. So for this entire exercise, it may take 30 minutes. That's 15 minutes of research and 15 minutes of sharing. You have to keep everybody on track and on time. A key piece of this whole exercise is that during the sharing session, every individual will have a note pad or simply a one paper on hands. Well, they'll take notes about some of the ideas they really liked and why they liked them. Now, at the end of this, we're not going to vote on any ideas that have come out of it. This is just informational. This is to kind of enhance the next step, which will be a brainstorming session where we can pull some of the ideas we
found and tailor fit them to what we are trying to accomplish. Maybe we want to integrate some of our solutions a little bit more. Maybe we want to integrate some of our flavor personality a little bit more.
But we're going to take a concept and reverse it onto something we actually are trying to solve again. Cell phones, laptops, get out there, dig, find information. While this does seem like an incredibly simple exercise, everyone researches different, everybody types in different keywords, so everybody will bring different results to the table. And that combination of ideas and insights is going to add an incredible, I always say, incredible, inspirational, groundbreaking amount of ideas in the follow up. So this is just before an actual deep dive brainstorming session. Informational. But the output from the brainstorming session is about tenfold in quality because of this simple 30 minutes effort.

""Stacks on Stacks"" is your go-to exercise for organizing and prioritizing ideas quickly and effectively. Think of it as building a tower of creativity, where each idea adds a new layer.

Materials: Post-it notes and Sharpies for each participant, a board or wall space with lines for organizing ideas. When to use it? Ideal for teams needing to generate and prioritize a large number of ideas quickly, especially in the early stages of project planning or strategy sessions.",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732362/lectures/39187374,,"Stacks on stacks. In this one, you probably don't want more than five to seven people. You can do it with less. Certainly you can definitely do it with more. It's just going to add a lot more time to this. You could do it with a group of 30 people, but, I mean, it's going to take up probably more time than it's. Than it's worth. So I would recommend subdividing those up into, you know, groups of six or seven people. Public math, whatever that comes to. Okay. What you need for this one is a bunch of post it notes for everybody. Everybody gets their own and a sharpie, and then preferably a board. And this can be on a wall. You can use tape to do the lines like I've drawn here. You can put it on a board and draw them out yourself. It's really up to you. This is what you're going to get everybody to do. Everyone is there for some kind of common purpose. So it's mission, vision, value, strategy, etcetera. Right. How might we fill the blank? Well, for this one, you're going to ask everybody to come up with four answers or solutions or thoughts revolved around that one question. Okay. And have them write it without talking about it. So it's silent. Maybe play a little bit of Enya, because everybody loves Enya, if it's true. And give them some time. I would give them at least four minutes. And stress the importance of how specific or detailed oriented you want to go into a specific topic. Okay. You can do more than four ideas, but no less. So everybody has a minimum four ideas. You get everybody to do it. They are now around a board like this. This is what you're going to get them to do. So imagine there's five people. They're kind of in a school circle around this board. And now you're going to get the first person to read the very first one. If anybody else has one, they're going to kind of clump it together. So this is like a moving affinity diagram, but it's not really shown in that sense.
Okay, so cool, somebody else has one. Instead of going in order, allow that person to speak as well because it might be a different type of idea. So whatever this idea is. Okay, cool. I've got something similar. They read it. Cool. Put it down together, move to the next one. The next one? The next one. You go all the way around, then you tell everybody. Okay, you can only take one of your idea to put it in the top. One of your ideas down here, one at the very bottom. And then you have to throw one of them away, like, what's your worst idea that you came up with? Like, discard it? Because at this point you will have heard from everybody else. You put your three up there. So this is what's going to end up happening. You're going to end up having, you know, somebody will have one there, here and here, here and here. And finally here, here and here. Okay, cool. So again, three people. It's not five, just an example. Now you have the discussion. You vote on the best ones of these, or you look for common patterns, right? So say this one and this one are like that. But this idea is better. Let's move these down here. Okay, maybe this one and that one are very similar to that one. So you're going to put these down here. You're going to rack and stack this so that only one out of all five of you, right? So five of you came up with four ideas each. Public math 20. There's 20 ideas. You're only going to let one come to the top. You're going to allow two to
land here in the middle, and you're going to allow three to land at the bottom. So in the end, it'll look something like that. The very best idea at the top, two, and then three at the bottom. Now, from here, depending on how you rack and stack this, they would be kind of vertical. I've done it horizontally, but you'd have them kind of in a vertical fashion like this.
And then you would create columns off to the right. Those columns could be the who, what, when, why, how, where, what kind of resources do we need? Where are we going to run into trouble? What's the duration? When should we start? Like all those questions that you would want to get, get at, or plus up from. And now you're going to write them as you go. I have found that in a group of five people, you can divide and conquer this so quickly. You can say, okay, Johnny, you're going to do all the durations. Susan, you're going to do all of the who's. Who is the belly button that we need to press to move forward? Who is the this, who is the that, etcetera. You're going to do this, you're going to do that, and you divide and conquer and you fill out this whole chart. So now you've got, arguably, prioritized without really having the discussion in depth about priorities. You have the single best idea, maybe call that the now you have the next two ideas, maybe that's the soon. And then you have the last three, which could be like the later our future development plan. So eight great ideas, and then you have all of the solution sets, the who, what, where, when, why, how behind them, so that you can reflect on this. Now, assume you have 30 people in a group. Everybody has done this. Now you get to share out those ideas as a whole with a group. Are there any other groups that independently came up with the same idea? I like to say that's incredible. That's great. Some people think that's not a very good use of everybody's time if everyone's kind of coming up with the same solutions, but you're validating that it was in fact a great idea. What if they're different? I say that's great, because now you get to see that these people independently came up with the ideas themselves. Then they got together with four other people and put them on a board like this. Then those groups got together as a whole. And so having different ideas is great. You're fleshing out these independent thoughts from individual to small teams to whole groups and teams. It's a really good method to do it. You can tweak this so many different ways. I actually wrestled with teaching this in like three or four different formats, but I ultimately settled on one that's generic, so that you can kind of make this exactly what you need to do for your own style and outcome that you're looking to achieve. So for a group of five people, this should not take from start to finish teaching everybody what to do and racking and stacking. It shouldn't take more than about nine minutes. If you're getting in the realm of 1520 minutes, then this has not solved the purpose of efficiency and effectiveness for you. And you need to potentially try something different or speed them up any less and you kind of risk not providing the quality answers that you need from the group. So kind of tweak it as you need, as you see fit. And there you go.",problem finding,"['""Stacks on Stacks"" is your go-to exercise for organizing and prioritizing ideas quickly and effectively']",,

That's when the stakeholder map is the perfect tool to use. Now, to do the stakeholder map, all you need is a group of participants. Again, I like five to seven as the sweet spot, a flip chart post its. Each individual will need their own post its. And of course, sharpies. Everyone will need sharpies. In fact, I need one right now. What you're going to have everyone do is simply write down all the individuals involved in the scenario we are looking at. For today's purposes, I'm looking at a coffee shop and the individuals involved in the process of going through a coffee shop. When we think of our customers, right? So who all is involved in a coffee shop? Who are the players? We call them stakeholders. We know there's different employees. And when we expand even farther from barista or cashier, we know that someone has to be baking, someone has to be making the goods. Farmers have to be supplying the coffee beans, they have to supply the flours and materials. The flour and materials to make baked goods. There may be a factory involved for the cups. There could be an app where you order online, and someone has to make that. And behind all of that, there's also an owner of the coffee shop that may not be an employee on the field. And when we think of customers, there's just a lot going on. Right. And to put order to that chaos is what this exercise is for. So allow everybody five minutes to put up everyone they can think of that's involved in the process of this coffee shop. We can go as deep as the farmer and the coffee bean. We can go even deeper if we have to, but I think this is about the right level. So we're going to focus on now figuring out how these stakeholders interact. It's great to have a list of people that are involved in the experience we're focusing on. It's even better to understand how they interact so that we can identify some core moments that are causing friction hurdles or problems altogether. So to do that, we have a simple, not high tech method. We're going to draw a line from one individual, one stakeholder to another. Now, that line can only go in one direction. That's so this doesn't get confusing. And our second rule is that every line must also have a description of the interaction. So we can imagine the cashier is going to pass on the order information to the barista. That's pretty simple. Well, maybe the barista is going to give them the coffee, right? That's pretty simple. Now we know the customer will probably go through the drive thru and ask the cashier.
That will be passed to the barista. Well, the barista might need to talk with the baker. The baker will maybe give suggestions of flavors. We'll say that we'll also have a delivery person who interacts with the baker, who interacts with the owner. The farmer and the baker could interact. The farmer and the owner could interact. Regardless, you can see the layers of complexity that you will find. An interesting thing that I'd like to highlight. Remember, arrows can only go one direction. Every single arrow drawn should have a description of that interaction. So the delivery person, what are they doing with the owner? The owner, what are they doing with the farmer of the coffee beans? At the end of the day, what you're
going to have is an in depth view of how all the different pieces and parts interact with one another. And from here, you can dive even deeper to highlight. You can give all the participants a handful of red dots and ask them to place the red dots on the interaction that causes the most friction throughout the entire experience. This exercise can take up to an hour. I prefer to try and keep it within 30 to 35 minutes of deep discussion around who are the individuals involved, the stakeholders in this experience? How do they interact? Try and get every interaction possible. And then what are the core moments of frustration? From there, we can pull out those frustrating moments and start brainstorming on solutions on opportunities to improve the overall experience. You may find that they get caught up in details and get caught up in depth. If you find people going too deep, such as the customer types we know at our coffee shop. There's a lot of remote workers at our coffee shop. We're near a school, so a lot of kids come in after school because we have this awesome vanilla frappe thing that's super delicious. That's kind of like a milkshake, right? So understand the different customers to a degree. Don't dive completely into their Personas and knowing everything about them. Maybe you'll find yourself getting caught in the weeds of the delivery driver who hired the delivery driver and such. If that is helpful to the conversation, allow it to go deeper. If it is distracting and focusing in on something that actually doesn't impact our situation and the problem we're trying to solve, then we can table that and say, let's try and focus our energy on more important matters at this moment. Okay, so this is stakeholder mapping. This is your snapshot, your view into the world, the environment of all of our stakeholders and should give you and your group a deep understanding of the problem at hand and possibly highlight that problem enough to where you can directly move on to brainstorming or need to dive deeper with some more research.",problem finding,"['A quick process for visualizing the entire environment\nsurrounding a given topic, situation, or task']",,

This is where you pulse the audience in some way, shape or form before you arrive. This can be done in a ton of different ways. One, you could get the host or the person bringing you on board, the boss or it doesn't matter to answer a bunch of questions that you have and you could send them in an email, you could call them and you're having them give you insights into the organization or the team or individuals, et cetera. You could send out a survey to them to populate out to the masses, et cetera. In the end, all you're looking to get is a couple really good problems or ideas that you can then put on a piece of paper and put around in numerous stations, around a room or on a desk or in index cards or on the very first sticky note that you pass out to every single person. Right. The purpose of this, obviously a little bit of prep work to get you there. The purpose of this is to save a lot of time. When everybody comes in. It can be kind of like an icebreaker. At the same time, it is very meaningful to kind of move the ball forward, right. So instead of me giving a bunch of rules and regulations and things that you got to do for me to get X, Y and Z and then pass it out and waste a lot of time, I can do that before everybody gets here. Pass it around, put it in modules. My favorite thing to do is to put a flip chart in numerous stations around the room. And I try to get the number of flip charts to correspond to the number of people that are coming. If there's 30 people coming, I like to have at least seven to ten flip charts so that it's not too crowded. I try to do more. 15. It's a lot, I know, but at that point you're only going to have two people at any given flip chart, which I think is a good number to have. Any more than that, it gets crazy. Any less than that, you're kind of on your own. You can do this. A one, v one. So if you have ten people, you put up ten boards and you use it to say, okay, for the amount of time from here to there, two minutes, we're going to focus on your station. When I say go, you're going to spend those two minutes. When I say stop, you're going to turn to your right and everybody's going to rotate around clockwise or counterclockwise, whatever you want to do. Or you just allow chaos to take place and you say go and write on as many as possible. The one at the end with the most places that they visited wins and everybody's competitive, or a lot of people are, they're going to run around the room and put as much stuff all over the place as they can and they're either going to plus up these ideas or put their own, or they're going to kind of dive a little bit deeper on the root cause or the smart metrics that are following it, et cetera. So you can have it so that they write it out actually, or on post it notes where they go and put it on there. It's completely up to you. Again, the purpose of this one is to get it in advance so that when they show up, you hit the ground running. It's a really good way to divide the group so everybody gets their blood flowing before you start. That's why I called it an icebreaker in the beginning. If you do make it a competition, people are going to be moving really, really fast and that's going to kind of wake everybody up. You could do something like this after lunch, which sounds a little bit counterintuitive, but they'll be a little bit sluggish here and there. But when they move, and you could say the ground is lava and there's a whole bunch of games that you can
play to get everybody to move faster. You can move them through on time boxing. Hey, you only have 30 seconds. Go, go, go.
