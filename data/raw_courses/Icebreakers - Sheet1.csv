1-Word Story,Easy,"As many as you like! Groups
work best when less than 10.",People. Imagination. Laughter.,4-7 minutes,"A story with an intention. Before starting, select a target
word. The group’s goal is to weave a cohesive sentence
(or sentences) that eventually end on the target word. The
hurdle: each participant can only say one word at a time,
bouncing around the room until (hopefully) someone can
add the pre-selected word. Create a meaningful story, a
sense of comradery, and a lot of laughs with this short,
simple icebreaker.",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732552/lectures/39190167,Before: Beginning the session or serious module. After: Kicking off the session or a break,"This exercise can be completed with as many people as you'd like. I recommend keeping it 15 or less or chunks of ten people or so if you've got a large audience. The purpose here is to. You don't need anything to tell a meaningful story that actually has a. So what? It's coherent. It's actually a full sentence or full sentences on working together, putting in one word here and there to create it as you go. So I'm going to bring in Johnny over here and we're going to demonstrate. Johnny doesn't know what we're about to do. Well, he does because I just told him, and he's a facilitator, so he gets it. But we are going to pull a random word. Can you give me a random word?
Dolphin.
Dolphin. We're going to tell a story on a dolphin using one word each. We have not practiced this. We failed miserably at doing this before.
I'm really bad at these types of games, so I'll be your example of the person that's bad and how to manage them that needs help. I need help.
Okay, dolphin or dolphins?
Dolphin.
Dolphin. Here we go.
Once there was a little girl that loved to dance, period. She decided that one dolphin.
Okay, all right, well, here, listen. All right, listen, listen. The purpose of any icebreaker? Warm up like this, where you are tempting to get people to laugh. It can happen in one of two ways. It can happen out of just pure and total humor, which that was not. It was incredibly awkward. It was a word I was not expecting Johnny to say. He cut straight to the chase and I laughed. I guess it was. It was funny in that respect. But so what ends up happening with these is people expect the word to be something specific they have in their head how this sentence plays out. And when they hear other people add these words, they get frustrated. They're like, oh, you could have ended it right there. You could have done it. You could have bridged the gap. And somebody will add a word that inevitably makes you go around again in order to come full circle with the story. And so it's just really interesting to see the different perspectives that people have in life. And you need to realize, look, if we can realize this in a very small atmosphere right now with this one word story, when we are ideating on problem sets and solution sets, if one word was challenging for us to get around,
how challenging is it going to be when we don't all agree on the problem at hand or the solution or the way ahead, et cetera? It's going to become more complex. And so kind of letting go of the fact that you're going to get it right every time can be a caveat or a. A learning point to this type of thing. One more story can be in pairs. It can be with, like I said before, a group of people. I try not to make it so massive that everybody is just pointing and laughing at the person. That just completely fails. Try to make it a little bit.
More close knit, if you could. This is one word story."
2 Truths and a Lie,Easy,"5-7 participants per group, can have
multiple groups.","Post-its & Sharpies for each individual, flip chart or
wall space for placing Post-its.","10-20 minutes
(depending on participants)","An engaging game that can be used at dinner parties or
workshops. Supercharged alignment and connection
between participants. Each individual will create two
obscure truths and one seemingly truthful lie to be
shared with their group. Get ready for laughs and
learning!",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732552/lectures/39190168,Before: Beginning the session or serious module. After: Kicking off the session or a break,"Two truths and a lie. An instant classic. One you may have heard of before, one you may have done at dinner parties, even one that works extremely well in any situation, whether it's with high ranking officials, C suite members, down to kiddos at the elementary school. It's playful, it's fun, it's engaging, and it helps the group get a sense of camaraderie, like very few exercises so simple could possibly do. So here's the materials you need. Each member of the group will need sharpie and post it. Pretty basic. What I like to do as well is prep a space on a nearby wall where I have one section. A left side that's truth and a right side that's a lie. That's. So later on, the group can decide which idea is a true truther and a liar. So here's what you do. Each participant is going to take their post it and their sharpie, go off in a corner, and their job is to come up with two true things about themselves and one, well, not so true thing. The real trick is to try and make them so interesting that it's difficult to tell which is true and which is a lie. So one more time, your participants come up with three post its. Two are true things about themselves. One is a little white lie that is still juicy and sounds fun. So I'm going to give a quick example. I'm going to write these down real quick. Wow, that was fast. So here we go. I'm going to hold it close. Here we go. First one, I got on stage with Kid cudi at Lollapalooza. Number two, I was attacked by wild dogs in the jungle of Brazil. Number three, my mom dropped the ball, didn't write my name on my birth certificate correctly. Now, in the next few seconds, you viewers try and guess which two are true and which is the lie.
Now you're thinking what he's lying about. Maybe he's lying about nothing because all those are so cool and crazy.
Okay, by now you should have decided. I wanted you to get the full workshop experience. I would say, move the ones over. Move the ones over. Move the ones over. We'll say this is the true side. This is the lie side. I've never been on stage with Kid Cudi. I was attacked by wild dogs, and my mom did drop the ball on riding my name on my birth certificate. So two truths and a lie. It can take a bit of time. I like to separate my groups into smaller groups of five so that they're able to share, laugh, really get in depth for some of the most interesting things about themselves. I was telling John earlier in one round of two truths and one lie. One of my participants had the postage of djed at MTV Spring break has nipple rings. And what was the last one? John got arrested. Got arrested in Disney World. Which one did you think was the lie? I thought it was. Honestly, in this area, it was not. It was the Disney world. So you learn a lot of weird facts, you get a lot of laughs, you get a great sense of togetherness in the room, and Max should take 20 minutes of your day. Well worth your time. Two truths and a lie. An old one, but a golden one."
5 Second Test,Easy,Unlimited.,Sharpie and paper for each participant.,3-7 minutes,"Time crunched discomfort. This tool helps the group
get used to drawing up the confidence of the team and
get those mental legs running for future rounds of
brainstorming. What are we learning? Communication
through sketches is easier than we all first believed.
Who thought confidence could be gained in 5 seconds?
Now everyone does!",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732552/lectures/39190169,Before: Beginning the session or serious module. After: An introduction or workshop kick-off.,"Five second test for this energizer, I like to use it at the beginning so I might call it a warm up. All you need is for each participant to have paper and sharpies. Here's how we do it. So the five second test is used to one introduce everyone to drawing. Get them used to drawing simple and give them confidence at doing so. It also helps them generate ideas quickly. We want to see what comes out of their brain as fast as possible. So all we're going to do is a simple five second test. So each participant will have a sharpie in their paper to write on. It can be post its and what we'll do is we'll give them a topic and they have to draw something that would describe that topic in 5 seconds. So we'll get started. Started with something easy. Baby 54321, go. As you can see, this is how most people draw a baby. I've never met a baby with a single strand of hair pointing up, but for some reason that's what we think of next. One flower 54321. Done. Pins up. I'm going to draw a quick flower too. Most people draw Daisy. Not sure why. I think that's just a weird statistic. So what are we learning? We're kind of all drawing different things. It can be done in a large group. You call individuals out. Hey, could you show us what you drew? One. It doesn't matter how detailed it is. The goal of drawing is to actually effectively communicate an idea. It doesn't have to be a masterpiece, it has to be effective at sharing our thoughts. And that's the beautiful thing about it. So we're going to do one more on topic. Innovation 54321. I'm going to gamble and say 99% of you drew a light bulb. Now, associating images with ideas is something that we're going to do throughout the workshop. So you're going to need to embrace this simplicity of drawing. Now all we really drew were circles and squares, so not too difficult. Now you should, and the participants should have the confidence to draw and share their ideas whenever you call upon them to do so throughout the workshop. Again, best if you I prefer all my workshops have five to seven people, but it works best with any amount of people.
Make sure you control how many people you call on. Hopefully this will take only four to five minutes to get the people going, get some laughs as we share the different wild ideas we might come up with and then move on to the input. As John says, the next exercise to get your people on their way to success again. That is the five second test."
Animal Noises,Easy,Unlimited.,People (who will probably be confused).,1-3 minutes,"An icebreaker to help participants develop creative
confidence by adventuring into the ridiculous. Inspired
by improv, this hilarious tool will shift the group’s energy
to playful joy and chaos. 20 seconds of mayhem!",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732552/lectures/39190170,"Any time the tone of the room needs to adjust. Mind clearing, energy infusing","For this one, you don't need anything. You need people that are probably wondering what the heck you're about to do. You're going to open up the scene by going in a second here. We are going to interact with our environment as some kind of animal. Okay? This could be a dinosaur or a fish or a snake. It doesn't matter what it is. I want everybody to think right now for the next 30 seconds, what animal you're going to be, okay? So you give everybody a chance to think, and then you say, all right, listen, this room is about to come alive. Everybody in here is going to act and react to their surroundings as that animal using the noise that you have, okay? And if you've got some introverts in the room, you can say, hey, listen, it's okay if you take out a piece of paper and a pen and draw the animal that you're considering, and then other people will act and interact with the animal that you've drawn. I'll give everybody about a minute to do that. It doesn't have to be a Picasso or anything like that. And then you give it a second. You make sure you answer any questions for everybody, and then you say, go. This one is powerful because you have told the entire room that they're going to do this. So for the majority of the room, they're all going to start making noises at the same time, which is hilarious. People are going to be a pterodactyl, which is just. I. You start crying over on the side because you're laughing so hard. And cats and some people are snails. It's just really kind of weird what people pick, but it's hilarious. And some people are, like, pretending to eat other ones. Some people are flying by them. It doesn't matter. The room turns into pure and total chaos. As a facilitator, you gotta stop it before it goes too far. So consider 20 seconds of allowing it to go maybe 30, where it's just enough that it hasn't gotten old. People are still laughing. If you've continued to move where people are not laughing anymore and they're wondering why they're still flapping their wings, you've gone too far. Okay. This is something that you can do at any point in time. It takes less than two minutes from start to finish for explanation, allowing them to draw something, interacting with one another, and then kind of calming down after the fact. Two minutes, maybe three, tops. And you can really shift the tone of the room around to look. Let's shake off what we were thinking. Before. Let's move on into the next thing with a clear mind and a lot more energy. So maybe after you've had a gut bomb after lunch or something like that, you can bring this one to light and get everybody really excited to jump back into it."
Best Day Ever!,Easy,4-10 participants per group.,Humans and their ideas.,5 minutes,"A moment of reflection. Let everyone think of the
greatest day they’ve ever had or ever COULD have! This

door to connection via stories and shared experiences.",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732552/lectures/39190171,"Before: Something serious or not serious. It’s about connection. After: Starting a workshop, but at any time!","This one can be done with any number of people that you want. Recommend doing smaller groups so, you know, five to seven people, but you can have it as many groups as you need. Five, seven people. It's super quick. Less than five minutes. In order to describe it, have them do it, reflect on it, move on. You're going to need nothing for this, really. You want everybody to reflect on their single greatest day that they've either ever had or that they ever could have. And you're going to get them to describe this day in 30 seconds or less. Very important here to emphasize what 30 seconds really and truly means by saying something to the effect of, hey, instead of having everybody get on their soapbox and talk forever, I've got this alarm clock that's going to interrupt you with this very weird and awkward noise or I am going to cut you off. It's an inevitability. Half of you will get cut off by me. Please don't take it personally. I'm going to cut everybody off. 30 seconds means. 30 seconds means 30 seconds because we're only doing this for 30 seconds, right? For 30 seconds. We got it.
Cool.
You're going to do it for 30 seconds. Sounds good. Make sure you prepare for 30 seconds. That's also very annoying, but it gets a point across 30 seconds.
Okay.
Everybody plans their thing for, let's say 30 seconds and then you say go. If you're in a small enough group and you're really going to work together for the whole day, having ten people or so, just step in the middle and go, hi, my name is John. My perfect day would be if I could do this, this and this. I wake up like that. We do some kind of lunch over here like this. I don't know why mine revolves around food. Maybe yours does, maybe yours doesn't. Maybe it's horseback riding or hang gliding or whatever, or just sleeping in or a day without kids or don't tell your kids, like all of these different things, you're going to hear what makes people tick. It's a good way to get to know people. It's super quick. It has nothing to do with work. It has really nothing to do with anything other than opening the door of conversation, of how you actually relate to the people in the room. People remember stories. So hearing somebody talk for that intro of their story of their best day is going to help most people remember? Oh, yeah. You know, like, I don't remember her name, but I do remember that she loves ice cream. And her favorite day is, you know, going down by the beach having a good thing of ice cream and wrapping things up with an awesome movie and some popcorn for the day. So you're the popcorn girl.
Cool.
Like, whatever that is. Okay. Do it anytime you'd like. Super short break between something serious and something serious or something funny and something serious. It doesn't matter. You can throw this one anywhere you'd like."

exercises. After: A break, “gut bomb” from lunch, or following a mentally strenuous activity.","If you know anybody out there that has any kind of trademark or patent on the name Bob Ross, please change this to something else or tell me that you're about to sue me so that we can figure this out and maybe cut. I call this Bob Ross. Pretty little trees. You know, the guy, he's incredible. Okay, this is where you add a little bit of improv into your day. This can be done very, very well at the end of a lunch period or something like that, or end of a break where people are coming in. You could do it in the very beginning of the day, but I think there are better ones for that. This is kind of like to bring everybody back into the fold. So you're going to have somebody come out, potentially an assistant. Can I have an assistant, please? You're going to come out and I'm going to say, I need you to be a tree. Okay, cool. So we got a tree. Okay. We tell everybody we have a tree. Now, we need to add something to this that would be in the same scenery as a tree. So somebody might come up and they might say, I am a bush. Somebody might say, I'm clouds, somebody might say, I'm a bird, et cetera, et cetera. Okay, so let's say the very last person in this scene is a dog peeing on the tree. Awesome. Okay, so now pretend you're a dog. It would be me, but I don't have four assistants right now. So we have a dog. I would tap everybody out, kick everybody out of the circle. That was a tree, a cloud, part of the scenery, and now we're left with a dog. Okay, now we all leave the scenery, and now we have a new one. It has nothing to do with the old one. You can't repeat anything that's already been done. And now we have a dog that we now need to act or interact with. So somebody might be a fire hydrant. Somebody might be a fireman or woman. Somebody might be whatever, right. The person that's left here at the very end, Johnny the dog, would get to pick, who am I going to leave in this scene? Thank you, Johnny. Johnny might say, I want to keep the fire hydrant. Okay, so now we have a person that's left as the fire hydrant. Everybody else leaves, you have a new scene. You create a new scene around that fire hydrant. So you go and you go and you go until you kind of see who's remaining. Right?
Is there two or three people that haven't gone? You try to get them, you encourage them to go in by going, hey, there's two or three people that haven't gone yet. This exercise is over after everybody's gone once, so let's get it out of the way. Let's make it comfortable and easy. One person at a time. Come in, add to the scene, tell us what you are, and then stay in place. Okay, this one. People just come up with some crazy stuff from this scene, and some people's minds go in some very weird places. And you have to kind of improv off of why somebody is in the scene. I don't even. I don't have a craziest one off the top of my head right now. They're crazy. Okay, this one again, after a break, after lunch. You need to bring the energy up. You can do this. I'd say with about 15 people. Any more than that, you could probably go to 25 if you have enough time. I'd say 15 people. You should be able to get through this entire thing in about four minutes. Five minutes, 25 people. You're looking at ten minutes. So make sure you have enough time to really bring everybody into the fold, et

Cake,Easy,Unlimited,Paper and a writing utensil.,5-7 minutes,"An icebreaker based on lateral thinking, this tool forces
participants to think outside the box (of cake) and can
lend credibility to the facilitator. A quick mind game,
“Cake,” is a sweet way to segue the conversation from
an introduction to creative thinking.",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732552/lectures/39190174,"Before:Kicking off a workshop or series of
activities with high mental demand. After: An introduction, break, or questions about
the facilitator’s credibility","Let zimmy cake. Quick exercise. All you need, some paper, a sharpie. Each individual is going to need them. This exercise is a simple lateral thinking test. Again, lateral thinking versus linear thinking. Linear thinking. A straight line, that's a, b c. That means each step has to be completed in order to get to the next thing. Lateral thinking, you create more options, more opportunities, and in the end, you get further, faster. So this exercise is used to get those juices flowing so that you're not thinking directly in line. You're actually being a little more creative. Thinking outside of the box, which is not an outside of the box term for thinking outside the box. And here's how you do it. You need everyone to draw cake. Don't have to be Picasso. Look. I'll even draw a little candle. Gorgeous. So I need all of you just to draw your own cake. And here is the challenge. You're going to have three cuts with a knife, three cuts to total eight slices. So, three cuts to total eight slices. Now, what I like to do is give everybody a minute, maybe a minute and a half, to see how they're going. Everybody one will get used to drawing, which is important. They get used to the fact it doesn't have to be pretty. We all saw John's face drawing earlier, hopefully doesn't have to be perfect, doesn't have to be Picasso. Again, you have three cuts of a knife to make a total of eight completely equal slices. Now, once you've paused for a bit, you're probably trying to figure out right now how to go about it. I'll show you, my liege, how to go about it. So I'm going to redraw that beautiful cake I did earlier. The most common one, people will cut it in half, meaning vertically in half. Is that the correct this way? In half. And then they're going to slice it. Boop, boop. Now, you've got eight equal slices with three slices. Now with three cuts. Now, if you're trying to be crazy, right, you're trying to gain some credibility, gain some buy in, and honestly, just make yourself look a little more clever than everyone else. Here's what I like to do.
Next level, cut the whole thing in half. Now, what you're going to do is stack the cake on top of the cake. Let's see if I can draw that really fast. Really pretty, really fast. Really pretty. Something like this. Your stacking cake on cake. Then you slice it down the middle again. That's your second one. And then repeat. Now, you've got eight slices. Eight completely equal slices. Although maybe some icing got stuck to the bottom. If you're going to be all technical like that, Jim in the back, don't get technical on me. You've got eight equal slices in three cuts. Now, again, this. Let dim eat cake. You can just call it cake instead of doing an offensive accent like most people. Most people do. And it gets the people going. It gets them thinking. It also just kind of puts some energy in the room. So let them eat cake and you can have it, too."

After: A break or stressful moment.,"Not all superheroes wear capes. In this case, everyone is going to and everyone's going to feel like a little superhero. So all you need in order to do this exercise, which is meant for as many participants as you want to, as many participants as you can probably control in a space, you'll need a flip chart, a big one like this. Notice these. These are way too expensive. They're sticky at the top. They're like giant post it notes. Okay, so that's one thing. And then each individual participant will need one of those single sheet of those for their back. They will each need a sharpie. You will want them, maybe, maybe even a pencil, because sometimes people jab with sharpies and bleed through the flip chart. And here is what you're going to do. I'm going to bring in my handy dandy participant, John, and I'm going to show you how each participant should be set up. Now, remember, this is for each participant. Give me a little spin. This will be their superhero cape that they get to have on their back. Now, here is the important piece. Each individual is going to be set up. John, are you comfortable? Oh, yeah. Each individual is going to be set up with one of these on their back. The responsibility of all other participants while you're playing music because you're getting good vibes is to write a compliment, write a quality about the individual whose back you're riding on. A moment that you share together, something positive about them that you think stands out, at least in your mind, could be. Wow. Remember that time we had coffee and we just really connected over our families? Remember that time you helped me, you saved me. You saved me on that project when I couldn't figure out how to format the file or this guy is next level. This girl is incredible. This girl is on fire. Right, John? All right. What this does, and again, you'll want to do it towards the end of the workshop. It just ends on such a positive note. Everybody will take their. You could probably walk, fly away like a superhero. Everyone can take this home with them. It's a sweet moment where you just feel the support and recognition of everyone in the team. A lot of times someone will share something that connects so much with the individual. They get a little teary eyed. Then I'm so empathetic.
I get teary eyed. And then we're all crying happy tears. And it's just a great way to close a chapter on what has been a hard day of thinking, of working, of work, shopping. So maybe not all superheroes wear capes, but in this cape of compliments. It's all good vibes."

After: Kicking off the session or a break.,"Colonel Mustard with general Sanders in the dining room with three candlesticks, two paper clips, and a dolphin named jezebel. That's right, kids. We're gonna play clue in this warm up, which is recommended for ten individuals or less, or else everyone ends up clueless. Here's what you need. You can do printouts. We're going to keep it simple just to show you how easy it can be to make something. You're going to want to draw this up and notice a very important key point. You're going to want to put numbers on every single page. This number will be important. So you're going to give each one of these sheets that has number one, hobby, favorite food, hometown, and most interesting fact about the individual. You're going to give one of these to each of the participants. We like to have them laid out on the tables, perhaps looking extra profeshy. Professie. People say that now, and we're going to play a round of clue. Here's how it works. Each participant will fill out their hobby, their hometown, their favorite food, and the most interesting fact they can muster about themselves. Then we're going to make sure they memorize that number, make sure they don't show anyone else that number. That's their secret code. We're going to throw them all into a big pile in the middle, shift them around, change it around. Then we're going to hand them out one by one. So each participant now has a mystery person that they are searching for. Key rules. Searchers, questioners, clue finders. Make sure that here's the key rule. You cannot say any of the words that are used on the responses in your question. So if someone says kayaking is their favorite hobby, you cannot say, hey, do you go kayaking? You can say, do you really like water sports that involve paddling? And I could say, yes or no. You could say, how are the rapids at this time of year? And is that something you do frequently? You can get in depth like that, but you can't pull directly from the words. Okay, you're going to walk around the room. Now, if you are hounding someone for more than five questions, it's hard to keep track of this as a facilitator. But over five questions, you're toast. You're on to the next person. Give everyone five to seven minutes to walk around the room, ask some questions, and then have them write at the bottom of the page their best guess for who the individual is. Have everyone stand in order of the numbers they actually were, and then give a quick hey, who was who and then see how people come together and start sharing and start laughing. Overall, this game is just a simple way to get everyone to know each other. We've learned where they're from, some random facts about them, and we've gotten to ask questions and engage. The big bonus is even while you're looking for one individual, you've probably gotten to know five, six, seven individuals over the course of your questions.
So key points remember to tell them to remember their number. Sometimes, a lot of times they're going to forget them. If you can write them down, if you can prep the sheet beforehand and print it out, it is smoother, it is easier, it is more professional. But I like the aesthetic of a hand drawn sheet. And overall, this exercise, again, if you really dive into it,
should take ten to twelve minutes. If you're just trying to do it extra quick, I wouldn't try and do it in any less than seven or you'd be clueless. And that's our clue of the day. Our blues clues. Blues, blues."

simple but profound exercise. Each participant will be
challenged to create the story of their own life, drawing
out the moments that shaped their life (on the Post-its)
and given a small space for adding text. Just like a comic
book, images blend with a brief text as the group gets to
intimately know one another.",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732552/lectures/39190177,Before: Beginning the session or serious module. After: Kicking off the session or a break.,"Smooth intro comic of your life. Now, this one you're going to want to use whenever you're trying to generate a lot of connections with the individuals in the room. This is much more intimate. This is for a much smaller group, so no more than six, or else people will just be uncomfortable sharing at that level of intimacy which you need, what you're going to need in order to run the exercise. You can see I need post its. Each individual person will need a setup like this six post its on a single page of standard a one paper. And what theyre going to do is create a simple comic book. So theyre going to want each have a sharpie, each have this setup, and youre going to give them the challenge because were trying to get to know each other. Were going to take five, maybe six minutes and were going to let you draw out images of the important moments that have highlighted and molded you into who you are today. So I'm going to walk you through a quick example of what it looks like. It doesn't have to be beautiful. We're going to focus in now. It doesn't have to be beautiful. These are simple drawings. As you can see, I was born actually not such a healthy little kid. I had some bad lungs on me. You can also see at the top, no smoking because, one, I lived in a tent as a baby for the first months of my life, and two, my grandmother stopped smoking the day I was born so that she could actually come visit me next. Another important moment in my life. I fell in love with soccer. I'm from a small town. No one played any sports like me, so I was lucky enough to find the channel that soccer was on tv when I was 14. As you can see in the top corner over here, that's actually Zidane, a soccer player headbutting matarazzi. In the final, I cried like a baby. I was a France fan. It was very emotional. What you do with your participants is let them walk through. I like to do it paired or in threes. Let them share their lives, let them get to know each other. And you can dive as deep as possible. Here you can see on the far side. There's a sad face with me flying to what would look like Brazil the day before or the days before I went to Brazil, a family member passed away. My mom encouraged me to go to Brazil to follow my dream, even though it was a tough hit on my family in general and even harder that I couldn't be there to help support them. So as you get more intimate as you get more comfortable with one another, you're going to be able to reach deeper. During the workshop to get the most out of the participants. There's going to be a level of trust, of transparency, just because of this exercise. Now it is a heavy one and you may get some tears. So be prepared. Understand that people only have to share at the level of intimacy they are comfortable with. If you come with an example prepared of how deep you would like people to go, like minimum, how deep you would like people to go, that's the best practice. Show them what you're expecting of them and then they'll follow suit.
And a lot of times they'll dive even deeper. So comic booking your life. A simple exercise that in the end does take about 15, maybe 20 minutes, depending on how well the conversation is going. But the effects can last throughout the day, throughout the weeks,
and especially if you're on a project that's going to have continuity, that's going to continue for a longer time. This is a great beginning to your chapter. You can keep it. A lot of people will take it home. Some people have even framed it. They've never framed mine. My mom hasn't either. But it's a simple, fun exercise to get to know one another."
Dance Moves,Easy,"Just the facilitator. Participants
can be added if dancing shoes are
provided.","The natural gift of dance moves
or lack of dance moves",2-4 minutes,"WAKE UP. In order to get the group’s entire attention, the
facilitator will first embarrass themselves before terrifying
the room with some serious dance moves. Why? By being
vulnerable as a facilitator, the bar is set for the rest of the
team. Acting silly is safe. Thinking differently is
encouraged. Best of all, if you are lucky, one participant will
show off their skills without encouragement. No dancing
skills are required.",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732552/lectures/39190179,Before: Beginning the session or serious module. After: Kicking off the session or a break.,"You don't need anything for this one except for moves. Okay, this is the setup. I tell everybody, I'm about to show you my single greatest dance move that I have ever had. I've perfected it over the years. It is very meaningful to me. So without talking about it, I'm just going to show you. And that's what I say to them. So I come back, make sure there's enough room. I try to create some space here and then I do it. Sound effects work. They help a little bit. At this point in time, everybody has completely either lost their mind, have no idea where they are. They're either laughing at me, and since I'm not laughing, they're not laughing with me. This one is meant to get everybody to wake up. What the heck are we doing here today? Etcetera. I follow that by going, all right, for the next, I'd say, minute, I want you to think of your favorite dance moves because everybody is going to come to the center of this room and give their favorite dance move. And then I say, I'm just kidding. You don't need to do that at all. The warm up does not involve any people. You can do this for 1000 people. It doesn't matter. You can do it for two. Although it's probably more awkward to for some reason than having a lot of people. It's kind of like telling everybody you're starting the day with some hot yoga and you make sure you're serious about it. And everyone's like, what is going on here? Here's the. So what? You have done something very special here. You have created a vulnerable moment for yourself as a facilitator so that you gain some credibility. Moving on. You've also gotten a few people to laugh. You've got a couple people to maybe cry. I'm not really sure. And there might be somebody out there. This happens, I'd say, 1.7 times out of five. Public math. Somebody knows how to breakdance and they will come out in the middle of everyone and they will breakdance and everyone will be like, oh, my gosh. I didn't know you did that. That's so cool.
And it is cool. And it's a way to kind of get everybody really to just relax. There are some embarrassing things here. There's some serious ones here. You can make the conversation go from there to tailor into what you want to accomplish for the day as your workshop. You do not have to be good at dancing to do this. It doesn't even have to be a dance move. It could literally be anything that is very embarrassing, that gets everybody to think, I'm gonna have to do that embarrassing thing in front of everybody also. And it still accomplishes the same type of thing. So try it. Send me a picture. I'd love a video. Send me a video. I'd love to see it. Even if it's just you practicing and going, will this work? And if I laugh at you or with you, I'll let you know."
Dice,Easy,5-10 participants per group.,"Die with space for writing, marker,
questions, or prompts.",5-8 minutes,"Interactions and introductions can be a roll of the dice.

Look at that. A simple little die. Can't say dice. Next thing you need, marker. So you can write on it. Number of participants, probably five to ten. You don't want to go crazy. Now. Here's how to do it. On each individual side of the die, I've written things like nickname, hometown, worst job. Best job. Well, not best job. That's too easy. Surprising skill. What you do is have the participants take it, roll it. Whatever lands on top. That's the one they have to answer. Now, if you are in a virtual space, you can roll it on your own. Whatever your thumb lands on. An easy one. Hometown? Well, shoot. I'm from Monroe, Louisiana. And then you get the conversation going again. This is just a start out, maybe a session, maybe just after lunch. Get people going, make everyone have some silly little conversations that are fun. That's when to use it. Why specifically use it? To get just some good vibes going throughout the room. It's no pressure. It's simple. Everyone has a little bit something interesting to tell about themselves. I love the one weird pet. I've had chickens, I've had mud puppies.
I've had leopards. I don't know who had a leopard, but granted, it was in Louisiana, so people have a little bit of everything. It's true. I can see John shaking his head. So recap. I don't want to call it kill or die. That's too intense. The dice game. Roll in with it and you'll have a good time rolling out the rest of the day."
Draw Yourself,Medium,"30 participants or less, which can be broken
into smaller groups for efficiency and ease
of facilitation.","Paper, writing utensils, and engaged
participants.","8-12 minutes
(depending on participants)","How does one introduce themselves? Do people even
like to introduce themselves? Instead of going around
the room to share who is who and how they can sound
cool, this icebreaker creates a moment of pause (4
minutes) for participants to draw their own lives and not
just a portrait of themselves. Draw the features of their
life and provide a snapshot into the life of one another.
30-second description per person.",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732552/lectures/39190182,Before: Beginning complex exercises. After: Coming from a break.,"For this one, all you need is a writing utensil, something to write on, and an eager audience. Okay?
People don't really like to introduce themselves. Some people do. Johnny probably does because he's got a super interesting story, but not everybody else does. And nobody really knows what to introduce themselves on. It's either family or work for the most part. And there's not anything super interesting about the going beyond that elevator pitch and digging in a little bit deeper. And so, to get everybody warmed up. Beginning of a workshop. They don't know everybody yet. And instead of going around the horn, the room and asking everybody to introduce themselves, where, by the way, everyone's thinking while everyone else is talking, what am I going to say? How am I going to make this cool? And you're getting nervous, and then it gets to you, and then you're done. And then you stop listening to everybody else. I don't know about you. That's kind of what happens with me. Sorry, not sorry. So you tell everybody, I'm going to give everybody four minutes, three minutes. It's up to you to draw yourself with as much detail as possible and put something in that drawing that is meaningful to you or impactful to you or a hobby that you have or something is in that scene.
Okay?
You want to give them enough time that they don't just draw a caricature. They're drawing something that is, you know, they're accentuating. Accentuating the features of their life, right? They're drawing one of their pets or they're drawing, you know, a table saw. Because they do a lot of diy stuff. I don't know what it is. Right. Everybody draws it. And then you have something very cool to show. When you go to the front of the room, the energy is on you. You're not worried about what you're going to say because you're looking at this terrible drawing. Because most people can't draw very well. Here's an example that I drew right before I started. It's not good.
Okay?
I didn't draw anything in there yet, but that's up to you. You can have them add one, two things, just do themselves, whatever, and then describe themselves in about 30 seconds, 45 seconds. If you have 30 people or more. This is very challenging to do because it takes forever. But if you're going to be together for a day, two days, three days, whatnot, it's worth diving in a little bit longer to hear their story a little bit more. Otherwise, something super quick. My name is John. I drew myself like this because I've got my thumb up. I always try to
find the good in what I'm doing, what I'm working on, and who I'm hanging out with. And the thing I drew in this image is a zipline, because I built a zip line in our backyard for my daughter. Blah, blah, blah. Right? And you get to know everybody in the room based on that one little thing. And you give them enough time in the very beginning to draw it so that when they're standing up there, they have something ready to go. For the most part, people are going to laugh at the drawings themselves. They're terrible. They really are. You haven't given enough time to really make it shine. And then when you're done, if you can get everybody with some tape, some painter's tape, to tape up their drawing somewhere on the board, it becomes really funny over time. During breaks, you'll see people go up to that board and go, yeah, this one's me. I suck at drawing. And they'll be like, oh, hey, I noticed that you drew a guitar. I also play the guitar. I'm in this band. Oh, yeah, that's great. I've heard of you guys. That's amazing. And people will always draw this connection with other people in the room based on that. You're getting away from what I do at work. You're getting away from that elevator pitch of this is my family type of thing. Although that's amazing and it's special. People like to know about the hobbies and who you are outside of the work environment, so they can relate to you in some way. Not everybody has the family thing that they can relate to. So this is a way to kind of put everybody on the same playing field really good at the very beginning. I don't recommend you do this any other time than the beginning, unless you add your own twist to it, because at the point where you've already established trust in the room, people are just going to be joking. Everybody's drawing, and it won't be as meaningful. So this is draw yourself intro."
Favorite Picture,Easy,"5-7 participants, as many
groups as desired.",Access to a phone or physical pictures (if on Zoom).,2 minutes,"Much like Favorite Song, this exercise focuses on what
we all love: ourselves! Each participant must find their
SINGLE FAVORITE PICTURE. The kicker: it has to have a
meaningful story behind it. Encourage each person to
find a special moment captured in digital form (or draw
it). This icebreaker develops a trusting bond between the
group that carries on throughout the session.",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732552/lectures/40817666,Before: Diving into the session or a serious module. After: A break or kickoff,"Favorite picture. You can do this by drawing, you can do this by googling, you can do it on computers, you can do it virtually in person, etcetera. All you need is either paper and a pen or sharpie or your phone. I recommend doing a phone. Everybody pulls out their phone. You give everybody about a minute, they find their single favorite picture. Now, here's the catch. It can't just be a picture of their family. It has to have meaning behind the family. Like, this was the time that we all went to Disney World and has, like, some kind of story behind it. Or we all did this for my wife's birthday, or we all did this for my brother, etcetera. And this is why this moment was special, et cetera, et cetera. Find that special moment, special picture, etcetera. If you don't have one that you want to share personally, find something online that basically conveys your hobbies, your interests, your favorite cookie. It doesn't matter. Find it. Right? You give everybody enough time. They find it, they draw it, whatever you're going to have them do. And in the end, it doesn't matter how many people you have. I recommend more than five, less than five. It becomes very intimate, and you kind of have to ask very specific questions and drill down into those pictures. But more than that, you're able to kind of move along pretty quickly. This can be something that you do at the very beginning of the day to get everybody to kind of get to know each other, loosen up a little bit before moving on. Share some very cool things about one another. Sometimes and oftentimes, I've seen this go very deep, where people share things they wouldn't otherwise share with a group of people. It brings in that trusted element so that when they're working together as a group going forward, things just go smoother for some reason. So this one is favorite picture. You have everybody share it. You have them talk about it, you have them pair up. Whatever you'd like to do at the end of this is completely up to you. But it's just a really good one. Doesn't require a lot of effort on the facilitator's part or the individual's. This is a good one."
Favorite Song,Medium,6-20 participants.,Access to YouTube or a music-playing platform.,5-7 minutes,"Much like Virtual Song, this is an interactive jam session.

another, it provides a mental break for the participants.",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732552/lectures/40817636,Before: Diving into the session or a serious module. After: A break or kickoff,"Favorite songs. We've all got them. In this one, all you need is a cell phone or a lot of imagination and the ability for people to sing their own. I don't recommend it. The more people, the better. This one takes less than two and a half minutes to explain. Have them do it. Move on to the next thing. The reason that you do something like this is to completely pivot from where you were to where you're going. It's a cool transition between that so that you kind of just have some pandemonium and chaos before moving on to the next thing. You have everybody give them about 30 to 45 seconds to find their absolute favorite song on their phone. Wait, wait. They find it. Then you make some eye contact with everybody and you go, do you have yours? Do you have yours? Okay, I want everybody to turn up their volume as loud as possible. Get ready. On the count of three, I'm going to have you hit play. And when you do, I want you to walk slowly around, just kind of make a loop around the room in between each other, etcetera, until you get back to where you started. We're going to be doing this for about a minute. No talking. Any questions, et cetera. One, two, three. You hit play. Everyone's holding their phone up and walking through. You're here in country and rap, and you're here in Enya and all kinds of stuff. It is chaos, lots of noise. Again, this is meant to transition from one thing to another. It could be used to come back from a break or after lunch or something like that to get things going. It doesn't add a ton of energy, but it is something that mentally allows you to have that break. You're listening to your own cool song, and then there's just other stuff going on out there you could tie it to. We all have our differences, and that's what makes us special, et cetera. You can do a lot of different things with this one. This one is favorite song."
Giraffe Gaffe,Easy,Unlimited number of participants.,Sheet of paper for each participant.,8-12 minutes,"Be willing to stick your neck out for this energizing

We all have them in our own houses. Some of us ride them to work. No, in this exercise, what we're going to do, what you need, all you need, in fact, is a single sheet of paper per participant. I've done this with unlimited number of participants. So if you have 300,000 people out there in person or online trying to do it, no problem. Standard sheet of a one paper. Here's what we're going to do. This is to get energy going throughout the room. It's super simple, it's super silly. Why it works, I'm not sure. I think because it's so chaotic. Here's the challenge. You're going to challenge all your participants to turn their one single sheet of paper into an origami giraffe. Now, you're not going to show them how to do it. You're not going to teach them how to do it. And you think this would be the hard part. They have 1 minute to turn this sheet of paper into an origami giraffe. Sounds tough enough, right? People will already be saying, oh, I don't know how to origami. Jim, again, always speaking up like that. It's okay because it gets more complex. You have 1 minute, one sheet of paper to turn this normal slice, standard a one slice of goodness into an origami giraffe. And you have to do it behind your back. Now key to tell them all. You can tear it, you can fold it, you can do whatever you want, but it has to be behind your back. And in 1 minute, and do give them 1 minute, you will see that everyone crinkles it up, causes all kinds of chaos. And then when they come out, because I do this so often, I am pretty good at it. They have an origami giraffe. Perfect. First try. Use this exercise to get everyone in the room energized. It'll cause a lot of laughter, a lot of fun. Best used after lunch, after a break. Best used to get everyone smiling after some rough stuff. Five to seven minutes is way too long. Probably two to three minutes is all you need to explain it and run it. Also encourage everyone to celebrate theirs and then give someone a shout out for you know what. That actually does look like a giraffe. Yours looks more like a just a kind of balled up thing like mine."

At the beginning of the workshop, not everybody will know each other. There'll be kind of an awkwardness amongst your participants. This is a good way just to get people moving and shaking and to get them sharing, sharing where they're from. First off, just pass it around. Ask everybody. Share their hometown. Point it out. The trick is when you pass it to them, they have to do one more step. Ball's in the air where it lands. Ask them to look at their right hands, pointer finger. Whatever country is closest to it. Or if you're an expert, whatever city is closest to it. Try and name something interesting about that area. Now, it couldn't be a made up fact. It could be a goofy fact. See, I'm near Australia. Australia. I'm actually directly on top of the Great Barrier Reef, which has sadly reduced significantly over the past three to seven years. If you want to travel to the Great Barrier Reef, you should do it soon. That was a sad fact. That was a really sad fact. Let's see if we can make it more positive. Let's put our shrimp on the barbie. There we go. There's my positive fact about Australia. I have a horrible australian accent. So how many people do you use it with? Usually about five to seven.
More than that. It can kind of get out of hand, can kind of go too slow. Your goal is to get the energy going, get people sharing. So you don't want to actually slow it down by having too many people talk. Talk. So this is a quick little exercise, four to five minutes, just to get the people going. Globetrotter."

After: Kicking off the session or a break.,"This is the greatest show. Shout out to my daughter. This is the greatest connection. Okay, there are a lot of variations of this. Warm up, icebreaker, day starter, whatever you want to call it. This is my favorite. You are going to attempt to be the consist of two people in this room that have the greatest connection towards one another. This can be done with as many people as possible. The more people you have, the more time you're going to have to devote. I'll throw out some random numbers for you so that you can at least baseline it. We'll say 50 people, five minutes, plus another two for sharing out. So seven minutes total for this workshop for about 50 people. I said workshop. I meant icebreaker, warm up, day starter, whatever it is. For you, the assist is the most important thing. This isn't about you. You're not going to go around and say, where are you from? What do you do? What are your hobbies, etcetera? You are going to do those things, but instead of thinking in your head, oh, you have nothing to do with me, I'm going to move on. You have to switch it. You are actively listening to what other people are saying so that when you come across somebody else that has a very close connection to somebody else, you've heard, you've got to remember, who was that and how do I get in touch with them? So here's an example. I was at an event. There were probably about 60 to 70 people, and we were introduced to this. And I met somebody. I said, I was in the navy. He asked me a couple questions. I said, yes, I lived in Japan. I go about my questions. I'm talking to other people. And then he comes up. He's dragging this person with him, just super excited. Holding hands. Brings her up, and he's like, she lived in Japan. You lived in Japan. And then he runs off. And so we both take our phones out and we're zooming into the map of where we lived. And we lived within ten homes of each other in Zushi beach in Japan, which is crazy. She was not in the military.
It was amazing. So we get to the end and they say, who here thinks that they have the best connection in this room? And we both raise our hand. We're really excited. We're pumped up. We've gotten to know each other very well. Favorite places to eat and favorite places to go and which trains to avoid and all this stuff. And we go, we have it. We have it for sure. We've got it. And we say it out loud. And long story short, we lost. The point I'm trying to make is the connections that you can make when you are not being. It's not about you. When it's about other people. When you are actively listening and you're trying to make. The assistant is just incredible. You're asking as many questions as you can. You're learning about a lot of people in the room, and you're attempting very quickly to connect what you've heard to what you're hearing now and bring those two together. It's a lot of chaos. And it's just a really good way to take a group of people that don't know each other and get them together. This could be outside of a workshop setting where all they're doing is listening to a keynote, and you could break up keynotes by doing something like this. You could do this before lunch, after lunch, the day in the very beginning. It's up to you. It's a really solid one, to get everybody excited. This is the name of this is. And I only started
saying that and all of this so I could remember the name of what I'm attempting to tell you, which is now I'm going to look, because I have. This is the greatest connection. Thank you. It's the greatest connection."

The age old game where you start something, you say something, you whisper it in somebody's ear, and they go all the way down to the end. Now imagine 20 people. You have everybody face in one direction. As a facilitator. You go up to the person at the very end, you tap them on the shoulder, they turn around and you show them something. There's no, you know, no voice allowed, there's no sound, sound effects allowed. You just show them something. So, example, you do something like this. Everybody can hear that, but you're not saying anything, right? They get it. They turn around to the next person, they tap them, do the same thing, it ensues. It goes all the way down until it gets to the very, very last person. We're all laughing and joking, everybody doing this one thing, and then the very, very last person turns around, does it, we all watch, and then we go back to the very first person that went and immediately have them do it again. You would think that it would be exactly the same, especially with something that cannot be messed up like that. And it is messed up every single time. I don't know if it's people that are doing it on purpose, but there's almost always some element of whatever it is and somebody's a little bit more careless about it and it changes into something completely different. So this might turn into this, which is like a dance, which turns into this, which turns into this, which turns into this. And now the person at the end is doing something that has nothing to do with the horse. It's crazy. Anyways, you don't want to do this for more than 25 people. It gets old. Nobody wants to sit in a line that long to do it. Wouldn't do it for anybody any less than about ten people or so. It can be done in about ten minutes, depending on if you have a conversation afterwards or discussion, be done as short as five minutes. If you get everybody up and running really quick, it is meant to just change the atmosphere of a room, move from one thing to the next thing. You can also tie on a lesson to it, to say, hey, we all have different perspectives. We see and hear things differently, and that's what's going to make our ideas stand out. We're going to come together and improve upon this from our own lens so that we can see the forest through the trees type of thing together."
Improv Stick,Medium,"Unlimited participants in
groups of 10-25 individuals.",People. Rolled paper improv stick. Enthusiasm,7 minutes,"It's more than a stick. It's a kick! Ignoring the rhyme, this
exercise intentionally forces individuals into an awkward,
pressure cooker scenario. Identify the bad apples early,
get the creative juices flowing, and establish the
principles of the session... all while using a simple roll of
paper as the core for the exercise. It could be a bat, and if
so this exercise is a homerun.",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732552/lectures/39190249,Before: Beginning the session or serious module. After: Kicking off the session or a break.,"One. So you're going to grab something like this, roll up some flip chart or something like that. And you're going to start by getting everybody in a massive circle. I recommend this for about 25 to 30 people. You can do it for smaller groups, and there is a benefit there which I will get to at some point. You can do it for even larger groups, but you risk potentially spending way too much time working on it. You start by going, this is whatever you would like it to be. It's anything. You're going to use this to demonstrate something. You're going to pass this to your left. They're going to take it, demonstrate something else and continue to pass it around every time the person is holding this. It's the opposite of a speaking stick. The person holding this is the only person not allowed to talk. So you're not allowed to say anything. No sound effects, nothing. You just go and you do something. Once somebody in the crowd has guessed what your thing is, you say it again out loud. And then you pass it to your left and they do it. So on, so forth, so on, so forth. Okay, so I'm going to give an example and then I'm going to pass it to Johnny, who can come in. Yeah, please. And then we are going to pretend that I am to the left of Johnny and Johnny's to the left of me as if it were to go around in a circle and continue on and on and on and on. So I demonstrate it again. The person holding this can't talk. The other person guesses what it is, goes around and around. Around. Here's the catch. You can't do anything that's already been done. So if somebody does something and says, this is a whatever, you can't use it again. So I go like this. Baseball bat. Baseball bat. So you say it out loud. Baseball bat. I pass it to you. Golf club. Golf club. Golf club. Tennis. Badminton.
Ping pong? Tennis. Tennis. Bad. Tennis. That's a horse. Yes, horse. Nice. Good. I'm glad I got that. A fork. It's a fork. Okay, we've continued around and around and around. You can leave just for a second. I'll have you come back in a minute. You go all the way around and everyone thinks it's over. Over and there. You know, some people get really confused and they try really hard and they can't think of anything you say. That's literally anything you want. But you started very basic, so most people were basic. Okay, then you start the next round and you go, okay, now we're going this way. I want it to go faster. Pick up the speed. As soon as you get it, do something. It is anything you want it to be. And I'll take it, and I'll go. I'll go like this. And somebody who would be Johnny would be next to me and would say, that is basketball. It's a basketball. It's an arrow. Arrow. Arrow. Surfboard. Surfboard. Wee. It's a swing. Tire swing. Okay, you get out of here. All right. So it goes all the way around again, and everyone's like, oh, cool.
We came up with better ideas. This was awesome. And then you go, we're going again that way. Even faster. Don't mess it up. Don't think too hard. It's literally anything. I'm gonna let you in on a little secret here. I'm saying this to them, but I'm saying it to you, I guess. Look around the room. Is there anything in the room that you could portray with this? Because
most people see this shape, and they think whatever they need to do is. Needs to be in the form of this shape. And I already said, this is anything you want it to be. So don't put your mind on the fact that this cylindrical thing, etcetera. So at the risk of making this too long, I'm not going to have Johnny come back. I was about to, but you have it go. And you go. And you go. Sometimes in the middle, I'll come up to a group as they're thinking, and I'll come up, and I'll rip it in half, and I'll be like, this is your object now. So now you have two. And people will be like, oh, no, I had the best idea, or, you stole my idea and all this stuff, right? And then somebody will do, like, chopsticks and, you know, drums and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. All kinds of stuff. Some people will make, like, walkie talkies and all that stuff. So here's the so what? Improv. That's great. It's cool. You get to see a bunch of exciting things. Everybody's really excited, pumped up the next. So what is describing to people where their a ideas are, their b ideas, their c ideas, they're d ideas, the ideas that never come up unless you are truly in a safe place and you have the ability to be wrong and truly just let your inner child out and think through the art of the possible. So your a ideas, the things that all look like the cylindrical shape, it is a tennis racket. It's a baseball bat. It's a golf club. These are your a ideas. You're not really digging deep. The second round, you notice I started with a basketball. That thing is as far from a basketball as possible, hopefully to get everybody to realize this is truly anything you want it to be. And then you go to your c ideas and your d ideas.
You can do this as many times as you'd like. Caution. It will get frustrating for a lot of people depending on how many times you go. The second time it's like, oh, wow, this is crazy. The third time it's like, whoa, again. And the fourth time it's like, come on, like, what's the point? I use this for a couple reasons. One, well, I already mentioned a bunch, but one that I have not mentioned yet is to determine who is in the room. Who have I pushed past the breaking point in something that only took six or seven minutes because it went around, it went around again, it went around again. And now they're like, this is dumb. I don't want to play anymore. Well, you now, without actually having to feel the room out, you know who that is, and you can orchestrate your thoughts and your actions for the rest of the day around that individual. Maybe they need more help. Maybe they need a better explanation going into things, et cetera. So I use it kind of as like a screening process. The other one is obviously to pump everybody up. Another one is to talk about improv and why it's important to back your partners up, etcetera. And the person that has the idea that's not allowed to talk. This allows you in the ideation phase to say an idea and then leave it. Say your idea, say your piece and move on, and let people build on your idea type of mentality. So this is a good one. Highly recommend it don't know how to end this other than just like that."

After: Kicking off the session or a break.,"The Nike check warm up. This doesn't involve running. Everybody calm down. All you need for this exercise, I'm going to reach it. Paper sharpie. Each individual is going to need their own stack of a four paper a four. A one paper. A four I think is huge. Don't get that. A one paper one, one per an individual. And here's what we're going to do. We're going to ask the group to draw simply six Nike checks on a page. Now, I'm going to draw them really quickly to show what kind of quality. We're talking about some basic Nike checks. Now, instead of just having them see how good they can draw Nike checks, what we're going to do is see how creative we can be by turning the Nike checks into something else. Example, I love drawing a little dude riding a wave. A little dude riding a wave. That's simple. I give everyone 30 seconds to draw six Nike checks. And then I give them a minute and a half to turn each Nike check into something completely different. Could be a high heel shoe or a clog. If you are in Netherlands, also known as Hollands, also known as Paisa's bajos. I think that's all I got right now. So what we're going to do is give everybody the materials, sharpie, paper, let them draw their six nike checks and then time box them a minute and a half to try and turn all of these into something completely different. This is called alternative uses. Now, this is a lateral thinking exercise in some ways, but it's also a great exercise that can be used before brainstorming or at the beginning of your session. I find it works best with ten people that can be lower or higher. Ten is a really great sweet spot because you are going to call upon them, say, hey, what do you think was the most interesting one you've created? Maybe they drew a surfer, maybe they drew a car. Maybe they drew something even crazier. Get a couple individuals to share. Try and keep it within five to seven minutes so everyone's attention is still high. That they're starting to get a feel for drawing, sharing and the order of operations for the day. Simple nike check, no exercise."

Sounds exactly like what it is. You saw John possibly go through an exercise of rock, paper, scissors earlier to start a movement. This also generates energy with a whole lot of different rules, but built on the basis of rock, paper, scissors. So we all can review the rules real quick of rock, paper, scissors. So rock, paper, scissors, one of each beats another. I'm going to show you how to play ninja Tiger Grandma, a fun game from people in suits, in boots. They all find it. It's a hoots, huh? Pretty good. Pretty good. So the order of operations is ninja beats tiger. Tiger eats grandma. Grandma, boars ninja to death. Now, grandmas out there, we love you. It doesn't mean you're not fully capable of doing anything in the world, but we're gonna exaggerate it for fun here, okay? So instead of actually doing rock, paper, scissors and that boring nonsense, we're gonna represent ninja with both the movement and the sound of wa. We're gonna represent tiger with a terrifying deep roar of meow. And we're going to represent grandma with the humble old school cane walking around. Okay, now, in order to do this exercise, you need everyone to pair up. So we need groups of two. So find a friend. I'm going to phone a friend to come in, and we're going to repeat that. Ninja beats tiger. Tiger eats grandma, and grandma cleverly poisons the cookies of ninja. Okay, so we're gonna battle off. Do you remember the movements? Can you go over them real quick? Ninja, tiger grandma. Very good. And the more noise, the better. We want energy going throughout the room. So we're just gonna do one round. In your case, it's best of three, and then rotate to find a new partner. Do that two rounds and you should be good to go. So here we go on three. No, I'm going to say, one, two, three, go. And on go, we both have to pick who we're going to be. Okay? One, two, three, go.
Wow. And as you can see, I was ninja. Cause I'm very clever. He was Tiger, which means ninja beats tiger. One more round just for fun on. Go. So I'm going to say, one, two, three, go. One, two, three. As you can see, it's contagious, it's playful, it's fun. And I'm significantly better at this rock paper scissors game than at the last one. Do this when the group is lacking energy. Do this at the beginning of workshop, after a break. Do this when you feel like maybe we've gotten a little too deep, a little too serious. Like I said, if you're in a suit. If you're in a very formal situation, it still works wonders on the atmosphere, the environment of your workshop. It only takes up about five to seven minutes. And you can do it with as many participants as you'd like. If you are one short jump in and become the other partner. If you noticed, one of the important things I was doing was I am the countdown. I say, one, two, three, go every single time. Otherwise you'll have complete chaos. So keep it organized, keep it simple, keep it sweet out there. We love you, grandmas. Ninjas and tigers. Go tigers."

After: Kicking off the session or a break.,"This icebreaker is super powerful for a group of however many you'd like. It's awesome because you're going to get people to open up with each other about very weird questions that somehow magically just seem to work. If you look up New York Times 36 questions to ask your significant other before you get married. I know that sounds ridiculous. There's three phases of these questions. I believe they come in twelve. So, you know, phase 112 questions. Phase 212 questions. Phase 312 questions. I am not talking about the third phase. That's very weird. Awkward. Please don't put those in your workshop. It will probably fail miserably. But the first 24, I believe first two phases are perfect. What I like to do is I pick out the ones that I like the most out of that group. We'll call it twelve questions. I pick out my favorite, and I write them down very big on butcher block paper, flip chart, on a whiteboard, something. I put them around the room and I say, look, I'd like you, when I'm done talking, everybody to stand up and answer and ask these questions, as many as you can, with as many people in the room as you can in five minutes. And I want you to go fast. Just tell them just enough about your answer that they truly have an understanding of what your answer is. You're going to get to know a lot of people in a short amount of time. And if you ever run out of things to say or do, you move to the next person? So this isn't this awkward thing where you're like, hey, we've run out of things to ask or say, like an elevator pitch where you just kind of run out of space. You say, next question. Okay, what do you think about this? What do you think about that? Etcetera. Answer the question, move on. So this is a way for you as a facilitator to step back and watch what people are doing in the room. Watch their body language, watch how loud they get, or I guess, listen to how loud they get. And this is going to be kind of like a tempo check for you in your workshop. I do it in the very beginning. You can do it after you get back from a break or lunch. Again, as many people as you'd like. I have done this with pairs, just two people. So it's really from two people to as many as you'd like if you put it around the room. I've done it before with cards where you have the questions actually printed out and everybody's got to just go around with their card and ask their questions specifically, they're going to get answers to just their questions and provide responses to just everybody else's question. So it's a way to kind of mix things up. All told, six minutes, no more than seven or eight.
What ends up happening at that point is the energy starts to die down. People don't want to answer these weird questions anymore. Potentially weird. And it kind of fizzles out. So don't hold yourself to a time. Don't say, I'm going to do this for six, seven minutes and start your clock. If they start to fizzle out around five, cut it at five. Don't wait for it to go past the point of diminishing returns. This is New York's Times 36."

It really is one of those weird things where not really much intention behind it other than get the people going, as they say. So the one handed airplane. Here's what you do. Assign partners to everyone in the room. Gonna partner up. Will you be my partner?
Oh, yeah.
Cool. Make sure you assign them so that like, no one's left out. Just go 1212-1212 throughout the room. This can be done with unlimited participants, but it would take a much longer time to partner them up.
Okay.
And it only takes seven or eight minutes. Each group should have one single sheet of paper. That's one sheet for two people. And they each can only use one hand. They can choose the hands.
Okay.
You don't have to assign worst hand or anything like that. And what they have to do is in a minute and a half, they have to turn their sheet of paper into a paper airplane. If you do want to give them some time, say, all right, I'll give you 1 minute for strategy and 1 minute for execution. So we could describe the type of airplane we want or what I like to do. Complete chaos. You have one and a half minutes to turn this sheet of paper into an airplane. We're going to have a competition after. So your tail's on the line. Okay. You want to make the best airplane ever made. One hand cannot touch it with. Okay, here we go. And we're going to try and make a paper airplane. Ready, set, go.
You're gonna, you gotta, you gotta press.
It down for me like this. See that communication is important. You flip it and I'll press it. That's pretty good.
Not so pointy, but that's okay. Do you do a double fold?
Yeah.
Oh, you just single fold.
Okay. Oh, I was cheating for a second. Almost. Okay, you hold here. Look, I'll hold and you slide. Okay. Okay, now let's get the wings going. What? Is that what you were going to do?
That's not what I was going to do, but then I committed to it. We should, we're not communicating enough. That's a point you can make with your participants. They need to be talking through as they're planning. John, hold up. What? We've created a really, really awful airplane. At the end, you are going to want to line everyone up. Competition have them throw it, see who goes the farthest. We encourage cheering throughout. John. It flew all the way about 400 yards. That fast, too. So John doesn't even want to stick around for the end of the exercise. The lesson is there is no lesson. That was fun, that gave us a lot of energy that's going to get us through the day.

They are going to receive a phone call from their bestie and they're going to carry on a conversation as if it were really happening. Here's the thing. Everybody's doing this at the exact same time. So nobody's listening to anybody else's conversation because they're talking. Okay? So the beauty of this is there's a lot of chatter going on. There's a lot of things happening. People are moving. Some people walk and talk when they do stuff like me. Some people sit down, some people, whatever, they're all over the place. And have them carry out a fake real conversation, a real fake conversation with their bestie. This takes less than two minutes to describe. Have them do it.

We're talking huge lists of questions. For me, I'm just going to share the handful. You can go online and find many more questions. Questions. These are the ones I've used. The ones that make make me giggle a little bit. So let's get started. Question one. If you were a flavor of ice.
Cream, what would you be and why? In this case, you want to get.
Really specific, so give them an example. I myself would be chocolate chip cookie dough peanut butter ice cream swirl with a little jalapeno in there because I'm a little bit nutty, I'm spicy, and I'm full of surprises. Huh. Pretty good response. So from a basic question, we get a fun answer. We get good camaraderie and energy from the room. I'm going to start shooting off a few more questions. When I dance, I look like. Obviously I look like Beyonce. Would you rather run 100 miles an hour or be able to fly 10 miles an hour?
So let me say that again.
Would you rather be able to run at 100 miles an hour? Vroom, vroom. Or fly at just 10 miles an hour? Now there's three fun questions. There are plenty, plenty more of hilarious questions on the Internet. I just wanted to get you started with the three that I think are easy, fun and playful. You can get deeper. If you had 25 extra hours a.
Day, how would you spend them?
If you were only allowed to have three apps on your phone, you had to delete all the rest. What would they be and why?
If you were able to live to 500 years, what would you do with the extra amount of time? How would your life change?
They can get playful. They can get probably less formal, less appropriate, more playful, more chaotic. But the process is simple. Prompt the group with a question, allow 1 minute for individual thinking, and then ask everyone to share. I find these work best in smaller groups. So if you have a larger group, divide it up. Allow them to share in a little circular setting so that everybody has the.
Chance to speak, laugh and enjoy.
A simple question can go a long way. Don't have to overcomplicate it."

After: Kicking off the session or a break.,"Remember, when this can be done, groups five to seven people or so, any more than that is possible. It's just you're going to add more time to it. So the most I've ever really done this for is about 30 people. I think beyond that, you're kind of asking to make this go forever, and at that point, you've passed the point of diminishing return. So small, smaller groups are better. You do remember when I like to bring this in as, like, an improv thing, and I describe improv a little bit beforehand by saying, hey, what is the magic of improv? What is, you know, if you could say improv is great because of fill in the blank, what would it be? And I go, okay. Oh, that's great. Oh, yeah, definitely that one. Yeah. Oh, I didn't even think about that. Yeah, awesome. Okay. Those were all great. So the reason that we do improv is to make your partner look good, right? If your job is to make me look good and mine is to make you look good, collectively, we're going to succeed as a whole. Remember when is an improv on? Remember that time we. And somebody will start it off and somebody will keep it going. You can do this one on one, or you can do it again with five, seven people or so in a circle where it just kind, kind of keeps going. It doesn't have to go in order. It can ping pong back and forth, but you typically start it with a scene. So you ask somebody in the crowd to say, let me hear something from the crowd. A hobby or something that you saw today that is really cool. And somebody will go, cupcakes. You're like, great. Remember that time that we bought 35 cupcakes together and then brought it across the street to those people? Do you remember that? The next person will pick it up and go, oh, yeah, I remember it. Susan was with us. Susan, remember that? Susan. Susan was with us. She drove us, but her car broke down. You remember that? And then somebody else will jump in. And somebody else will jump in. And the idea here is to make a compelling story that has nothing to do with, really anything, except for bringing to light everything that everybody's got together to kind of build it up. And this is a really good one to build camaraderie, to get everybody to learn a little bit about each other.
Some people are going to be shy, and they're going to need a little bit of help. And you might even want to say, hey, this exercise is over. After everybody's gone at least once, most people will do two or three when they hear something, they're like, oh, jump in. And they really want to make that story a little bit more special as they continue. So try it. You don't need anything for this one except for an imagination and being able to have a partner to kick it off with in the very beginning with a very quick remember when, where you can kind of go back and forth is important, in my opinion, to get that tempo high and the example right so that when they try it on their own, they're off to the races."

We're going to try and turn this roman numeral nine, wait for it, beautiful, into roman numeral six. Roman numeral six. Now, I'm always terrible at counting in roman numerals because I'm not from Rome. Obviously, you can tell by my outfit. So we're going to try and turn a nine into a six. And here is the challenging part. You can only do it with one line, one continuous line. It can be straight, squiggly, it can be round, but one line with one single line. You have to turn this nine, this nine into a six. I'm going to give you 1 minute to try and figure it out and I'm going to stare here on. Stay here, stare uncomfortably while you try it yourself. All right? So if you actually thought I was going to stay for a minute, just hit pause, that would be incredibly ridiculous. And we're not going to fast forward of me just like, look at that. So here is how you do it. Most people, they see it and they say, well, I could just cut it in half. And now I've got a six there. No, sir, no, ma'am, mm mm. Not at my table. That is not what we're looking for. The problem is we get so locked in with what we're looking at again, we can't see the forest through the trees. When we take a step back and think a bit more laterally, a bit different, we notice these are already letters, right? Ix is already a letter. Let me get a fresh page so you can get a fresh view. So with the ix, all we're trying to do is draw a six with a continuous line. My people, context. Context is everything. So in this warmup, which forces you to think differently, we realize context to the problem is what's going to help us solve it. If we're too close to it, if we're not understanding what the root of the problem is and being willing to think outside the box, we're never going to find the solution even if it's as simple as drawing a single letter. And that, my friends, is roman numbers."

participants have interchanged with one another.",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732552/lectures/40817653,Before: Diving into the session or a serious module After: A break or kickoff,"For this exercise, you're going to want to get a list of about ten questions or so for ten people. Eight questions for eight people. Twelve questions for twelve people. I would not go more than twelve people. This will take a very long time and could be an entire workshop in and of itself. It could also be very quick. I will explain more as I go. You are going to ask meaningful questions, some funny and entertaining, some serious and deep and kind of in between. For the number of people that are in your small setting, I think this works best for about eight people or so. It's enough to really get a team started on a journey together where they're working towards a common goal, etcetera. And the objective of this is to give everybody a question. That is their question. They are the owner of that question, and they have to go around and ask that question to everybody in that room, in that setting. Well, when they ask that question, somebody is going to ask them theirs. So at the end of this, everybody will have answered everybody else's question, but you will have the name of the person next to everybody that's answered right on everybody's paper. Johnny will be somewhere on it, on it once for everybody. John will be somewhere on it, Kathy will be somewhere on it, et cetera, et cetera. So you wait until everybody is done. The challenging part about this is mixing people up so that you never, you don't get to the end and have three or four people that haven't paired up. You want to make sure you do a switch. And as it goes, who has asked their question x number of times, you could either do that or you could have a clock and say, chill out. When you're done, we will all move at the exact same time to the next person, et cetera. It's up to you. At the end, everybody has all the answers to all their questions. What I like to do at this point is have everybody sit down around a table or get in a school circle with chairs, have everybody sit down, and then collectively you create a true story about a specific individual. So instead of having Johnny introduce himself with what he likes, what he doesn't like, something really deep, something really funny, etcetera, you have everybody else introduce Johnny. The point being, we say, all right, we're about to work on Johnny. Someone kicks it off, they go, you know that time that Johnny went out and got mint chocolate chip ice cream? So Johnny's favorite ice cream, mint chocolate chip. I'm making this up, but you're making a story out of it. Somebody else will chime in and go, oh, yeah, I remember that time we were listening to that song by blah blah blah. Again, favorite song, blah blah blah, whatever it is, right? And together, everybody is chiming in with their answer to Johnny's question. Johnny's answer to their question to say something more about Johnny. So by the time you get to the end, we know a ton about Johnny because he has spoken with everybody here and they've had a little bit of a conversation. Again, if you want to make this a very long one, you would stop and ask, why? Why? Why? You would dig a little bit deeper on that question. If you want to make this go very fast, then it's just the answer to that question.
It's up to you. But you get to the end, you get to know everybody in that group, and instead
of having that awkwardness where you're about to introduce yourself to the group, having everybody else focus their efforts on you, I have been told even by introverts, this is incredibly powerful. It is the equivalent of somebody calling your name. You just kind of melt a little bit. You're like, yes, somebody is thinking about me right now. And it kind of puts that pressure on everybody to actively listen to everyone when they're answering the question so that they can speak up on their behalf when it comes to answering their question. I love this one personally. You can make it your own. You can make it short. You can make it long. Either way, at the end, people are going to get to know each other a lot better. They're going to have a much more trusting environment to work in together."

the group","This is not the rock, paper, scissors you grew up with. This is something different. And I'm going to start here by saying that delivery of this one is absolutely key. This one can be done in the beginning, in the middle, in the end. It can be done anywhere that you need to buy. Four minutes of time, three minutes of time. I have done this before for about 400 people, and it's still the same amount of time. So, no, I mean a little bit longer, but it can be done very, very quickly. I think 400 people, I think took us about six minutes. It's really not that big of a stretch. Right. People are gonna go quick. So you start off by teaching everyone how to play rock, paper, scissors. Everybody knows, but not everybody knows. I've learned this the hard way. If you have a group of even 25 people and you start off rock, paper, scissors, there are inevitably two people that have never heard of rock, paper, scissors, and they're just going along and pretending like they know what you're talking about. And then when you say go, they are confused and it is painful to watch. So please describe how to play rock, paper, scissors. Before you start. You say the rules. You're going to go rock, paper, scissors, and then shoot. This is rock, this is scissors, this is paper. Paper beats rock. Rock beats scissors. Scissors beats paper. Say that two, three times if you want to be super obnoxious. I have explained it four times before for the group that didn't know how to play. And it's okay, joke around a couple times here or there. Now everybody knows how to play, so now you're going to actually play, hopefully with an assistant. Can I get an assistant where everybody gets to see how you want them to play? So you're going to face off, you're going to stretch before you play. Both assistants are going to get into it. Okay? And then you're going to square off again. We're going to go rock, paper, scissors, and then shoot. Okay, ready, set, go. Rock, paper, scissors, shoot. Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.
Whoo.
Yes. Stay here, please. This is what I need to happen. After the fact, the person that lost is going to cheer uncontrollably for the person that is moving on to the winner of another group of two. So that Johnny knows the depth of cheer that I'm looking for. It would be something like this. Let's say Johnny one. I'd go. He's about to face off to another pair, right? A loser and a winner of two other people that played. And he's gonna go. Let's go, Johnny.
You got this. Come on, you can do it. Let's go. Woo.
That's a. I won't ask you to do it. You can step off this side. Thank you. Here's the thing, their loser is doing the same thing that the loser in this pair did. Right, okay, so you got a lot of noise. So now someone wins. Now you have three people on that team, so to speak, that are cheering on that one person. Who goes to the next group, who goes to the next group. Pretty soon what ends up happening is you have one massive group over here versus one massive
group over here. All of these people are going for this one person, all these people are going for this one person and they're cheering on a game of rock, paper, scissors. Okay, so important to know, when you go and you meet this other group of two or four or whatever, you're going to introduce yourself. Hi, my name is John. Unless your name is something else, so that when you win, if you win, everybody on that team knows what your name is, so that when you move on to the next one, they're cheering uncontrollably for you in the next round. The objective of this is pure and total chaos camaraderie. And what people will pull out of it is, hey, look, individually we can fail, but when we rally around one another and we all support how we act and interact together as a team, the same way we do in rock, paper, scissors, where we're cheering everyone on for their wins, we can accomplish so much more. Right? You can go through and you can say, you can be negative. You know, we stink because of this or we stink because of that. And, you know, you can be negative or you can build people up. Hey, great job today. Looking forward to seeing you later, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. You can bake in your own kind of lesson for that piece before moving on into a module that requires that team building spirit. This one will give you a headache, potentially, if you yell as loud as I yelled. And I honestly don't know if our microphones are broken because of that. Probably. We'll see. Maybe we'll flash a warning up before I yell because maybe now you can't hear because you're hearing drums. Your eardrums. Your eardrums are busted. This one requires you to just absolutely buy in to that yelling at atmosphere. If you don't, this one will be very weak, so have fun."

After: An intense, energy-demanding module.","I was thinking about being silent for a really long time and then realized I didn't know how to come out of it because it was awkward and not as funny as I thought it would be. We have been talking a lot about how to bring the energy up, but what happens when you need to kind of bring the energy down? Silent time is the way to do it. You basically. You don't need anything. You tell everybody, and it can be done for a group of one, a group of 101. It doesn't matter. You basically say in the next two minutes, give them enough time to really, truly immerse their brain into what you're asking them to do. You're going to have two minutes to think of and then fill in the blank. It could be your best day, which we've talked about before. It could be a memory that you've had. It could be 20 years ago, it could be 20 years from now. It does not matter. It's a point of reflection or foreshadowing of something where you have the opportunity with nobody else talking. You don't have to share this with anybody. It's just two minutes. Sit calmly. There's nothing going on except for you and your thoughts. And in a chaotic workshop, sometimes having that silent moment where nobody can follow you to the bathroom or get a snack with you or put you on the spot for something is meaningful. So if anything, I would not reduce those two minutes. I would extend them if you're going to do anything. And I also would not go beyond four minutes at that point. Some people get really itchy. They really want to start doing some other things here and there, and they start fidgeting and moving around. Some people will even get up and go to the bathroom, et cetera, and it'll disrupt everybody else. So again, to calm everybody down, this is what you can use to truly move on and transition to the next thing without everybody still in a laughter state or still really wrapped around the axle about a problem that you were just solving. It's just like, let's calm down. Let's chill out. Silent time."

This is my favorite icebreaker of all icebreakers. It's my favorite for a lot of different reasons. Strap yourself in. This one's going to be a good one. Okay. I'm going to make sure that my audio is, in fact, on it is. So I'm going to continue. Similarities. All you need for this one sharpie, post it note. You can have stuff across the boards, you know, flip charts and whatnot. But all you really need is something to write on, something to write with. You're going to break the room up. I like to break the room up by saying, I need four people to raise their hand. You get four people to raise your hand and you say, you that corner. You that corner. You that corner. You that corner. Right. We're just going to throw out 20 people in this room. This icebreaker is really good for around the 20 to 30 range. More than that. And it becomes very cumbersome. It takes a very long time. I highly recommend this for about the 25 range. So you split up the room, right. You got four groups and you say, okay, in the next 12 seconds, I need even teams. There's four people, right? Keep your hands raised, please. These four people. I need four even teams. This is what I mean by even. Stop moving. Stop moving. This is what I mean by even teams. People that have been in the organization a long time, people that have been in a short time. I need a wide array for every group. I don't want you to be in the same group as a friend of yours. I don't want you to be in the same group as your boss. I want this to be very evenly dispersed teams.
You only have 12 seconds. Inevitably a lot of people are going to run to one and you're going to have to do some public math to realize that your group is too large and run to the other side. 12 seconds. Ready, set, go. Chaos ensues. They all break off. They go to their thing. Cool. That in and of itself can be its own warmup. Okay. Now you say, listen, I want you to come up with as many similarities that you share in common with your group. I'm going to throw out some examples of what I mean. We all like to eat pizza. I would say that is not a similarity. Why? Because I don't think it's specific enough. Do you all like pizza from the same restaurant? Have you all eaten pizza at the same restaurant? Do you all like pepperoni? Do you all like your pizza without cheese? Because you're a weirdo. Whatever it is, it needs to be like one step further than the traditional thing. I like to drink wine. No, I like to drink white wine. Who likes to do that? I like to drink red wine. Everybody has to have that one step further similarity. It allows everybody to kind of dive a little bit deeper. You're going to say, everybody that was raising your hand, you are the note taker for your group. I am attempting for you to get a minimum, a minimum of seven very good similarities. And I'm not looking for. We're all wearing pants today. It's freezing outside. Of course we're all wearing pants today. I want you to dive deeper. I like to travel, it's not a good one. I like to travel to Europe or I like to travel to Africa or it doesn't matter. Like, what is a place that you've all been outside of the United States? What is a place that you've been outside of in Australia or whatever. Figure it out, right?
Come up with as many similarities as possible. And then I say I'm going to walk around and I'm going to cross off. Similarities that I don't think are good enough. And it's kind of funny, et cetera. It allows me to walk up, read what they have written, listen in on their conversations, see how things are going, look at their body language, see that they're really jiving with each other. And I like to cross off at least one every time I pass by. It just makes them go that much further. I say, oh, by the way, this is a competition. Who can get to seven similarities that are good before everyone else. So now the clock is ticking, right? You need to go around and make sure that team over there, that's just crushing it. Just get rid of a ton of similarities on theirs. Okay? In the end, the game is made up and the points don't matter type of thing. You're going to understand that at some point anyways about everything that we do. Except the points do matter. I'm kidding. They're gonna go. You're gonna give them some time? I think it is probably gonna take about five minutes, six minutes if you count saying what they need to do, splitting them up, and then they're off to the races to get those seven. I say seven because of what I'm about to say coming up, you make sure everybody's got it. They're cheering, they're high five and they did it. They're really excited. They've learned a lot about each other. Hopefully you've gathered at this point in time that by sharing a similarity, something that they have in common. They have gone through more things that they do not have in common. I'm a cat person. I'm a dog person. I'm an only child. I'm a middle child. They're learning about their family, about their hobbies, about where they go on the weekend. They are learning so much about each other by just throwing it out there. And in order to get them to come up with five people or more, the more people you have in a group, the harder it is to have a similarity that everybody shares. Right. Sometimes those turn to, we all don't like this thing, anchovies. Right? Whatever. Okay. They get through it. They have learned a ton about one another.
They dove deep into each other, racking and stacking these things. Cool. Now you have four groups in this scenario where they're ready to roll and you go, okay, listen, I want everybody. There's no talking right now. I'm about to describe something and I don't want anybody to start talking or writing under their breath because I'm going to give you a finite amount of time and I want you to really buy into this amount of time. I'm going to give you 1 minute. And in that 1 minute, you are going to discuss amongst your team a team name that you all like and a fictional story about how you all became best friends, how you met or how you became best friends. However it works, leveraging the similarities that you have. Are there any questions? Okay, now here's the catch. At the end, you are going to present out loud to everyone your story, your fictional story of how you all became best friends. So pick somebody to speak. It can be everybody. It can be one person. You have 1 minute fictional or a name about your group and a story. Get it ready. Who's going to talk, when, for how long, et cetera. Here's one more catch. This is like cupcake wars. When I say time is up, time is up. If you don't take the oven, if you don't take the cupcake out of the oven, your cupcakes don't count. So when I say time is up, if you are talking, you are going to go first and you might not get as many points that also don't matter. Okay. You say go. They are feverishly figuring it out who's doing what. There's sticky notes flying everywhere. It's just pandemonium everywhere. This is the beauty at the end. You call on a team. They give a

story that is believable, it is hilarious. It involves how those people came together to come up with these similarities. They are not ever the same. They're always a little different. There's always, you know, like this one thing. We love this type of movie, or we don't like this, we're Star wars over Star Trek, like, whatever. In the end, this is what you're going to get. Teams that have sincere buy in and loyalty for each other, towards each other, for the rest of the day, for next week, for next month, forever. People remember stories, and when you are in a team with other people that came up with this crazy story, you remember that you met on at a Dave Matthews concert in line to get a beer, whatever, and you remember that, and it brings you closer together and it allows you to treat everybody else in your group like a human being when you're coming up with ideas. So later on in the workshop, when you have somebody give a really terrible idea, people aren't judging the person for the terrible idea. They just kind of move on and they have more trust and more faith that they're going to have each other's back.
And in the end, you've done improv. You've taught them how to very quickly break up into different groups. You have taught them how to do things on your timetable, which is very short. Get them going, get them moving. So it adds a lot of energy. It's something that is very good to use before an ideation process. You can use it after a lunch for energy. You can use it as a segue into discussing improv and whatnot. There are a lot of different uses for this. You can tweak it the way that you need to use it in your workshop, but it gets everybody moving, everybody thinking, and most importantly, it gets everybody teaming."

Infinite should have been the word there, but it's the same number of people. It's a lot. I highly recommend against doing this with three people because it's super awkward. So you're looking at 15 plus people. This will be great for. Okay. It takes no more than two minutes, so this can just be just enough for you to go from something serious to something else serious. Just kind of get everybody to loosen up a little bit. It could be when you come back from a break, it could be at the end of lunch, whatever. It could be during lunch. I mean, that's kind of weird, but whatever. Whatever floats your boat. Star wars. You are going to demonstrate with some other person. You're going to bring out someone. Can I get somebody? Excellent. Oh, Spider man. Wrong one. It's not in the same uniform. Well, it's owned by the same people, I guess. Anyways, you are going to demonstrate with this one person before you unleash it to the masses how you want this fight to go. You want it to be as realistic as possible. If people don't know what Star wars is, kick them out of your workshop, tell them to go home, and they need to watch all of them, starting with the originals. Okay. And we just demonstrate it. I'm just going to assume right now Johnny knows what I'm about to do, even though we haven't talked about it. Okay. Get out of here. That was excellent. So, after everybody knows what you want, you want everybody to be in a fight, pretty much, against everybody. They need to be watching their back. They need to be watching their front. They need to be fighting with sincere and total joy. That wasn't the right word, but they do need to have a lot of joy.
This is sincere and total worry that they might lose their lives to a lightsaber that's not real. Okay. You explain it. You do it. They do it. Everybody's pumped. I find the best way of doing something like this as an icebreaker is that you don't describe why you did it. You immediately finish and you start describing the very next thing at hand as if that didn't just happen. And it's kind of like, whoa, what just happened? You know, like Keanu. Whoa. That's what everyone's like. And I think that captures the hearts and minds of people. Gets everybody pumped. It's a really good one."

After: Kicking off a session or a break.,"I have never done anything as a facilitator more than I have done this single warm up icebreaker energizer introduction, whatever you want to call it. And the main reason is because it works. I know that it works. It works for elementary school kids. It works for admirals and generals. It works for C suite individuals. It doesn't matter who is in this group. It works. So what do you do? What do you need? You don't need anything except for yourself, as opposed to introducing yourself in the beginning of the day, you would use this. You get everybody in a circle. You come to the middle of the circle very loudly. I know your back is facing some people, but you go, you're going to remember four things. I need you to remember four things. And that's it. Four things. Four things. I obnoxiously say it over and over again because for some reason people forget all of this. So I repeat it over and over and over and over again so that it's really funny when they mess up and people laugh with and at them. You need to remember to say your name, your first name, a skill that you have that you're proud of, and a superhero power that you wish you had. You need to pass it to the next person. That's the fourth one. It's a hard one to remember. It's like name skill that you have that you're proud of, superhero power that you wish you had makes somebody else come into the circle. You do this for about 25, 30 people. Any more than that, it becomes cumbersome on your time. Although I think the most I've ever done this for is 60. And if you keep the tempo up, it's still worthwhile and fun and whatnot. Again, people remember stories very well, and so if you're able to kind of bring to life yourself as this thing that you're proud of, this hobby that you're proud of, this skill that you're proud of, there's a reason that I say skill. Otherwise people will come up here and they will say, I am proud of my family. And I would say, what kind of skill did you have to create that family? And I try not to do that. I try to preemptively try to prevent that from taking place because somebody out there is going to go. It's really hard work to be a parent. And I know, although my wife does most things and makes me just look good behind the scenes, she's a champ. So skill that you have that you're proud of and a superhero power that you wish you had. This is kind of how it looks. Hey, my name is JOHN. A skill that I have that I'm proud of is I can ride a unicycle and juggle at the same time.
And if I could have ANy superpower, it would be that regenerative stuff that wolverine has. I don't really want those things coming out of my arm, but that's about it, right? And then I go, Johnny or Susan or whatever, you. You. It's important to pick the second person as somebody that you know is going to follow the rules. They're going to have a lot of energy, and they're going to get it right. So I typically cue someone in, either a co facilitator or I bring somebody off to the side in the very beginning, and I say, this is what I'm going to ask you to do. I would like for you to crush it. The reason that I do this is so that the tipping point to make this go negative or dark is very high or low, depending on how you look at it. It's kind of like air conditioning. Do you turn it down or turn it up? I don't know. It's hard.
The point that I'm trying to make is if I go and I give it to somebody that gets in the middle and says, I'm not proud of anything, which I've had happen numerous times, then everything falls apart because the next person can get out of it by going, I don't have anything either. And then the whole thing is ruined, and you might as well quit and go home. Instead, you get somebody else that's really good. If you're really gonna crush it and you have a very important event. I'd get two people so that the first three are really good. It goes around the room. Everybody's got something good going, et cetera. You're going to accomplish a lot of things by this. Similarities that people share. You can almost create a band with the people that play instruments. Almost always. You can almost always find a group of people that could go surfing together or that could open up a wood shop somewhere or could start a bakery. There are so many of these that after you hear them a million times again, you might not remember that his name is Jeffrey, but you're going to remember Jeffrey loves to make chocolate chip cookies on Saturdays with his family. And he's really proud of the recipe that he's created with a little pinch of sea salt. I don't know. It's delicious, right? That's one element of it. The next one is the superpower. Right? You might not remember anything about Jeffrey. You might not remember what is the skill that he had or whatever, but you remember that he wants to be the flash or he wants to be magneto or something like that. And he'll give some reason, because it would be great for me to get to work by, you know, whatever, going across this bridge without getting stuck in traffic. Right. It's a way for everybody to get to know each other. It's super quick. I have overdone it to death, but I will continue to use it where it's necessary, where I know that I need a win. In the very beginning of a workshop that's going to pump everybody up, get them excited to work with each other going forward, create some kind of safe environment for them to work in.
You can do this after you get back from lunch as well, or a break. It really can be used anywhere you'd like. I'd say if you're looking at 30 people, you're talking twelve minutes or so. Twelve to 15 minutes to go all the way around. Inevitably, somebody will get on a soapbox and talk for ever. And you need to kind of figure out how to move that past. Like, hey, let's hurry it up. Let's hurry it up. This is superpowers."
Virtual Song,Medium,6-20 participants.,Access to YouTube or a music-playing platform.,5-7 minutes,"I WANT TO ROCKKKKKK! How do you connect in a
virtual world? A little jam session can go a long way. In
this icebreaker, participants are asked to proactively
share and be vulnerable in this silly song of an exercise.
Prepare for a screenful of pop stars and happy faces. Get
everyone out of their shell, out of a meeting mindset, and
into purposeful play.",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732552/lectures/39190337,Before: Initiating a full session. After: Kicking off a session.,"This is for you virtual facilitators out there. I don't know why I did this, but it felt good. Just like this exercise is going to feel after you complete it. So this is what you do. Beginning of a workshop online. You're going to get everybody to grab their phone, grab their phone, pull something up on the computer. You're going to say, find your favorite song and give everybody like a solid minute and say, hey, look, I'm going to just stand here awkwardly for 1 minute, legitimately, and you're going to find your absolute favorite song that you love to sing to. You know the words, you jam out to it all the time. It's your favorite song. Cool. Everybody goes and does it, 1 minute, etcetera. And then you go, okay, look, I'm going to mute everybody and I'm going to turn. I'd like everybody to turn their cameras off. So now all the cameras go off. Everybody's muted right now. I'm going to turn mine off as well. But you can still hear me. So now they still hear me. And I go, I'm going to count to about ten or 15 when I'm done. And I'd like everybody to hit play on their phone of their favorite song. And I would like for you to just sing your heart out. I mean, jam. Like, no one's jammed before, right? So there's, there's a reason that I have everybody turn off their cameras beforehand, because if anybody's given really weird looks, you can tell there's some people that, you know, have angst or anxiety to do it and you don't want to kind of ripple that through the crowd. You're just gonna roll with it. Some people aren't gonna do it. Most people are gonna get into this one. And the beauty of this, and I try to at least relieve some of the stress by saying, look, no one's looking at you. We're all jamming out. The purpose of this is you are fully involved in your song as if you are singing to the masses. But it's sort of private because you're doing your thing, everybody else is doing their thing, and nobody can hear anything. So all we're about to see is a screen full of faces just jamming. Okay, any questions? No. Because you're muted, you know, throw in a little jab here or there, whatever you go, okay, 10 seconds. Here we go. I mute myself. I hit play on mine. That's why I said ten to 15 seconds is just enough time for me to do that. And then I turn my video on.
And I say very loudly before I mute, I guess I mess that up. I say, come on, everybody turn on their. Their screens. You see everybody's faces start to pop up. They're all muted. They're all jamming out. And it is hilarious. It's hilarious. It's hilarious. It is funny. It's really funny. It's really good. This gets everybody out of their shell a little bit. It allows them to hear their favorite song. It kind of gives them that energy and effort towards working together in a group like we've talked about before. And it's a really good way for people to test the mute button on their zoom or whatever you are using as your video virtual means and the camera function as well. Also, if you know you have a phone next to you, they can look stuff up while they're in the middle of your workshop. That also helps as well. So again, can use this for as many people. The more the better. Don't do this for five or less people. It will be awkward. People will be laughing after they cry because it will be very, very, very awkward. Super awkward. Kind of like that. Okay, virtual song."
Worst Quality,Easy,"5-7 participants per group,
unlimited groups.",Paper and writing utensils for each participant.,"5-8 minutes
(Including introduction and completion)","A look in the mirror can be a beautiful or terrifying thing.
In this icebreaker, participants will be guided through a
moment of self-reflection by defining their worst
qualities and openly sharing. By being vulnerable
together, participants will have a greater connection and
better collaboration. A trusting environment is
established!",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732552/lectures/39190339,Before: Initiating a full session. After: Kicking off a session.,"Getting the jitters out over here. Okay, what you're going to need for this one, a writing utensil. Something to write on. You're going to start by asking everybody to write down three of their best qualities and make them feel a little comfortable by saying, you're not going to share these, okay, this is for you. You know, hover over the piece of paper, whatever you need to do. These are yours. The best qualities that you have as a human being or as a co worker, as a friend, friend, as a neighbor, like, whatever it is to you. The three best qualities you have, you're getting them juiced up. Maybe you're playing some music in the background. You give them about a minute or so to think through what it is. You get some good vibes going. Then you go, I want you to write down the three worst qualities that you have as a human being. And I want you to be brutal. You might share some of these, okay, so you're not going to share all of them. We've all got our quirks, et cetera. Write them down. Okay. At the end, you look around, you make sure everybody's got theirs. You're like, okay, now I want you to circle the worst one out of those three. Circle the worst one. Let everybody think for a second. They're going to circle it. You go, okay, listen, you're going to stand up. Everyone's going to go around the room and introduce themselves to everyone else in the room using their worst quality, okay? And I want to make sure you're a little comfortable here because this can be very overwhelming. Everybody's got something really embarrassing that they don't want to share, but the fact that everybody's got it, you're going to start to feel very quickly that you're not alone. Okay? So this is how I would do it. I would go, hey, my name is John, and I don't know when to stop talking. You know, and somebody else, whether you do the elbow or the fist bump, whatever it is, you move on to the next person, and the next person, next person. And what you'll notice, what you'll see is everybody starts to just come alive. In the very beginning, everyone will be like this. The introverts might actually say, I don't know if I want to do this, etcetera, if it's the right time to do it. Which is probably the very beginning of a workshop where people don't know everybody in the room or kind of at the end of lunch when everybody already knows who's on their team. Then this is a great one. It's super quick. By the time they write everything down, say everything that they need to say to one another, get a couple good laughs in and sit back down or stand back up, wherever you need to go. It's probably in the neighborhood of about four minutes. You can stop after the fact and say, why did we do it? What did you gain from it?
What are our fears of saying the worst quality about ourselves out loud? And what you're going to do is establish a very trusting environment before you kick things off in your workshop, or to bring, really, the energy back when you come back from lunch to get everybody laughing and joking around with one another. So it's a great one to use. You can tweak it to yourself. But I have found this to be very, very useful."
Yes And,Medium,Unlimited participants split into pairs.,"A room full of people, or not full.",6-10 minutes,"A classic of improv and a mindset for building on the
ideas of others. As adults, participants are often stuck in
the habit of poking holes. In this exercise, the group will
strengthen their capacity to proactively add to ideas, as
opposed to breaking them down.",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732552/lectures/40817661,Before: Diving into the design thinking process. After: Kicking off a session.,"This one can be done with as many people as you want. It is typically done as some kind of segue into design thinking or improv, or can be done kind of. Before getting a group to plus up one another's ideas or thoughts or solution sets, etcetera, I recommend if you're going to do less than six people, you make it a little bit more intimate. You make sure that you cover down on anybody, that if there's an odd number, that you jump in and help them out. This is for a small group or large group. You're going to split everybody up into pairs. So you're going to say, in the next 3 seconds, I want perfect pairs across the board. Ready, set, go. There's pandemonium. Everyone's running everywhere. You say, time's up, we have pairs. Is there anybody that doesn't have pairs? And inevitably, for some reason, they'll be like a group of four. And you'll be like, can you guys just like split in half? And it usually works. So now you have pairs. You say, what I'm about to ask you to do, everybody is going to take on one role and then I'm going to have them switch roles. So one's going to be asking the question, one's going to be giving the response. Then when I say switch, the person giving the response is going to ask the question person. You get it? They flip right? For this very first prompt, you're going to have everybody say, look to the other person and ask them a question. Try to get them to do something very simple. And their answer and response, no matter what you do, is going to be no. So I'm going to give you an example. Johnny's going to come in for context. Johnny, you're going to start small. You're going to ask me to do something, and then you're going to just plus it up and give me incentives to say yes. Don't get too crazy. Figure out a way, a real way to get me to say yes to what you're asking me to do.
Okay. And I can ask anything, anything you want. Can you drive me home? No.
And I keep asking more questions, correct?
Yeah. Yeah.
Okay.
But you're gonna stay on that track.
Driving you home.
Driving me home. You really want, you really need me to drive you home?
Would you drive me home for a Klondike bar?
No.
Would you drive me home for free ballet lessons for your daughter? No.
Would you drive me home so that I don't pop your tires?
No.
Thank you.
I'm not getting so he basically plusses it up. He tries to get me. He tries to get me to say yes. I'm gonna say no every time. I'm gonna yell out, switch to everybody. After I've seen everybody laugh or get really frustrated, etcetera. And when I do say switch, you're gonna switch it around. So if Johnny were here for this one, he'll come in for the next one, I would say, hey, Johnny, do you want to go to lunch? No, I'll pay for it. No, I'll pay for it and I'll give you $5. I really need to talk to somebody about something. I really need you to come to lunch with me. No. Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. No, no, no, no. All the way through.
Cool.
Then I stop and I say, what did that feel like? What did it feel like to be told no over and over again, even though you know that this was an exercise and you just gather it from the group, you get four or five people, they're like, it shut me down. It did this, it did that, it did this, etcetera.
Cool.
Okay, now we're going to do keep the same groups that you had. We're going to do no, but. So you're going to add that. But in the end, and I don't mean this one.
Okay.
You're going to add a little bit of but at the end. So, example, John, if you could come back in, you're going to ask me a question just like you did. Everything remains the same. You're going to stay on the same topic and I'm going to reply no, but don't reply to my no, but start overasifIsaidnoeachtimetogetmetosayyes.
Okay.

Okay.
So ask me any question you'd like. My response has to be no, but.
Do you think Philadelphia will ever win another sports championship?
No, but I'm getting really hungry and I just. I don't even have time for sports tonight. I just want to go eat.
Do you know what goes great with a good Philly cheesesteak is a side of watching Philadelphia sports. Do you want to go watch it with me and eat?
No, but maybe you could come over and we could watch Moana with my daughter together.
Maybe we could do Moana with a.
Picture in picture of Philadelphia sports so that we can talk more about Philadelphia sports.
No, but my daughter will probably want to do our hair, so we probably won't even get to watch Moana and we'll just let her do our hair.
Okay.
So it doesn't really matter what the person asks. He obviously cared about sports. It could be something like, if we switch roles, would be keeping the same question that I had before. Do you want to go to lunch? No, but I want to go to dinner. No, I really need to go to lunch. X, y, and Z. No, but I can go to lunch tomorrow, right? You're giving something else, right?
Okay.
Everybody does it. Everybody switches. You ask that question again, and then you ask the follow on question. What was the difference between the no and the no?
But.
And you hear it out. Okay.
Then you go for the last one. Last one. You don't need to switch. It's all together. Someone starts asking the question, and you reply yes. And. And you add to it. I don't want you to get so crazy right out of the gate. I want you to build gently up from the single question that didn't really mean much to something crazy. So we'll give you an example, Johnny. If you

come back in, I'll start. I'll ask you a question, Johnny. You want to go to lunch with me?
Yeah. And I love for us to spend a little extra time afterwards and just.
Brainstorm some ideas for our company.
Yes. And when we become super successful, I would like to maybe go in on, like, a taco truck together.
Yes. And on top of the taco truck, we could have a small patio that had a flip out pair of stairs.
So that when we arrived to the.
Place, we could actually park outside of.
Stadiums and see inside.
And people would be like, tacos and dine.
Yes. And when we become wildly successful, I'd love to maybe be on, like, a reality tv show with you.
Yes. And I'd love for us to have a vacation home together. Is that too serious?
Okay. Everyone's gonna do it. There's gonna be some awkwardness just like that. And at the end of the day, you're going to say, what was the difference between the no, the, the no but and the yes and right. You ask that question again, and essentially what you're trying to get at for them, other than just kind of getting comfortable with that pair or laughing and joking, etcetera, is the no is like slamming a door in your face. Right. Conversation's over. No active listening involved. I don't want to hear it. No, no, but I'm listening to you. But at the end of the day, I'm trying to. You know, I have something else. There's another agenda. You know, I am listening to you. I'm shutting this door and maybe opening another one it might not be the door you want to go through, but it's another door. Yes. And is like going down the hallway and throwing all the doors open. The sky is the limit. Right. You can go in here and in there and out there. It doesn't matter. The sky is the limit. We're going to get a little crazy here.
Okay.
So this allows you to build on the creativity of the people in the group. You can hear stories from one another of what worked and what didn't work. There's a teaching moment here. And again, you can make this short. You can make it faster. You don't have to ask the

questions after every single one. You can wait till the end. You don't even have to ask the questions at the end. You can mix and match it. I've done it before where we just do yes and we don't even do no or no but. I've done it before where we do no and we don't do no but or yes and you can pick your poison either way, as a transition, something after lunch, something to begin the day when you're about to work together as a team. This is a solid one."
"No Work, No Family",Easy,"5-12 participants per group,
can have multiple groups.",Excited participants!,"6-10 minutes
(depending on number of participants)","Getting a little deeper, a little faster. Most often, participants
will introduce themselves as their job position or their family
status. To get a little deeper and generate more profound
connections, participants will share their backgrounds,
hobbies, passions, etc., all without mentioning work or family.",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732552/lectures/41173472,"Before: A serious exercise. After: A break, low moment, or misalignment of the group","Our introductions that we typically provide to people, whether we're actually in an elevator or we're considering ourselves, the amount of time that we are going to a certain floor in an elevator with somebody, typically involve something about work or family. Almost always we identify with those two things. If we're at work, maybe sports, we can get to often, you know, the water cooler talk type of thing. But typically, people will talk about work or they will talk about family. And so doing an introduction with people in a room where they're not allowed to talk about either will really get them to dig a lot deeper and learn a lot more about each other than the typical skin deep type of conversation that you could have. Not to say that those conversations aren't meaningful, but this is just another layer, right? So you set up the room by. By having everybody say, look, not everybody's gonna say this. You say this to everybody. Everybody stand up. In a second here, you're going to introduce yourself to as many people in here as you can. We'll say at least five new people, minimum. With yourself having nothing to do with work or your family. I want you to speak for at least 30 seconds so you can have a buzzer or something over here where you say, you know, when you hear this noise, you're going to switch. When you hear this noise, you're going to switch and you're going to keep switching. This one, don't dive right into it, though. Give everybody at least a minute to think about what they're going to say. Maybe even two minutes, because they're going to have to dig pretty deep about hobbies, about likes, about dislikes, about where they live or come from or whatever. Some people need a little bit more time. You don't want to put them exactly on the spot for this one. This can be done very quickly. By the time you're all said and done, I said five, you're going to switch every 30 seconds or so, and you're going to get to know a bunch of people. So this one can go ten plus minutes and you can really immerse yourself in the group and you can cut it down to about five minutes. Minutes. If you're just going back to back to back to back 30 seconds each for two and a half minutes, plus the introduction, so could be pretty quick."
