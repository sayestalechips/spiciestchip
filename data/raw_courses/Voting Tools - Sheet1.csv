Pick a Side,Easy,"1-100+. Harder to count how many with TOO many participants. Best is
24 or fewer.","A group of humans, maybe aliens.",2-4 minutes,"Allows the group to visually perceive where everyone
stands (literally) on a given topic. Serving as a form of
rapid voting, Pick-a-Side ensures complete inclusion
when a group is seeking consensus.",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732391/lectures/39188030,"Before: Moving on from a discussion that needs
clarity. After: Sharing ideas or concerns around a topic.","It's like you're at an 8th grade dance in a terrible movie. Pick a side. Girls on one side, boys on another side or whatever. Not me. I was in the middle of breakdance fighting everybody or just myself. This one allows you to visually see not you as a facilitator, but the group gets to see exactly where the rest of the group stands in any given scenario by putting them in one place or another. Usually time boxing is a really good way to do this. So you say, hey, I'm going to give you a prompt. I'm only going to give you 20 seconds, 17 seconds, maybe I might even give you 13 seconds. Like not enough time to truly think through the response. After I'm done with this prompt, you're either going to be on that wall or this wall or that corner. In this corner you can set up stations wherever you want. It doesn't have to be one or the other, it can be several. And in these 13 seconds, I need you to be standing where you most relate to in this environment. Right. And you can get those pulses from everybody beforehand. What are the categories we care most about right now and put them up? Or you can just actively listen to what's going on. Pick those as a facilitator and then have everybody do that. You give them the prompt, you give them the time and then they go. You could have a neutral ground and you say something to the effect of, hey, right here is neutral. You can't decide. The problem with neutral is if you pick neutral, you are allowing me to call on you to get your exact opinion after this is over. And now you're putting them on the spot. Most people don't like to be put on the spot, so very few people will pick the neutral ground and then be careful. If somebody picks the neutral ground that likes to talk a lot, make sure that you let them know. Hey, I'm going to get your opinion really quick. 10 seconds or less. Why are you neutral and why didn't you pick these others? They might need to go to 15, 20 seconds, but it should be enough time for them to go. Don't have enough information? That's too many resources. I'm here because I'm kind of torn between these two. Something to the effect of that. So tell everybody where it is. Make those to directions clear, make the time box very short so that everyone's not looking around and going, where's Johnny going? Because I want to go where he's going. And then they go and vote. Wherever Johnny is, this one makes it very easy because you're able to go, depending on how large of a crowd you have, you're able to go, everybody, every group, count up your numbers. And then you go, how many you have?
How many do you have? How many do you have? I do this because I don't like to count any kind of numbers in front of an audience because I will inevitably mess it up. And public math and I don't work very well together. So I have them tell me, get the numbers. And I go, okay, well, you guys have it. You win. But I'd like to hear from the audience, why do you think we shouldn't do that? And then I make sure those people aren't talking, the ones that won, the one that had the majority of people on their corner or side. Why do the losers, so to speak, think that that should not be the case? And then I go, in three minutes, I want to hear. Just throw them out randomly. Let's hear it. And then I'll go back to that group that won and
go, did any of you change your mind based on what you just heard? Yes. No. We go into a discussion. This one is pick a side."
Impact over Easy,Easy,"3-10 participants per group, as
many groups as needed.","Concepts from a previous brainstorming activity, a
flipchart with the Impact Effort Matrix drawn, dot
stickers.",10-15 minutes,"What is it? Brainstorming is the easy part. Finding a path forward…
not so much. This tool provides a simple matrix to allow
for the rapid voting and ranking of opportunities based
on two simple factors: How much impact will this concept
have? How easy is it to get done?",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732382/lectures/39187663 ,"Before: Developing action items After: Brainstorming concepts (problems,
stakeholders, or solutions).","Impact over easy. Exactly what you need in order to prioritize your ideas. It can be used for problems. I prefer to use it on ideas exclusively. What you'll need is a flip chart, a stack full of ideas. Your participants who hopefully created those ideas. It's best done with, well, it can be an unlimited number because you are going to need voting. You're going to need dots, which John will bring me some dots momentarily. So, to get this started, we're actually just going to draw out a simple grid. We're going to have impact on one side and we're going to have ease on the other. As you can see, higher up, meaning the more votes for the idea with our blue sticky, I mean our blue dot sticker, sticker, sticky and sticker. Our blue dot sticker will increase the impact in the red. The more dots of red we have on an idea, the more easy, the easier it will be to complete that idea. So, as you can see, I have a handful of ideas here below on this chart. Our goal is actually just to map out which ideas are both impactful and easy to be completed. This is the sweet spot area. That's where our best ideas will be located. Simple enough. So what you do is draw this map, show all the ideas to make sure all the individuals understand what ideas are available to vote on. Everyone. All individuals can vote on any ideas. I like to give, depending on the number of participants, three to five votes to each individual of each color. That's three to five blue and three to five red. Make sure that's the same exact number for both. So if we were to have, say, make an online course, that could be impactful. But it is not easy. Trust me, I'm doing it right now. Or we could get matching tattoos. That would be easy, maybe. No, it would probably be hard to convince John and it wouldn't be impactful. So that's probably going to be our lowest idea. We could host a meetup that would be relatively easy but not so impactful. We could write a book that's pretty difficult and maybe a little less impactful depending on how well we write it. Or we could do a podcast, which I'd say similar impact, similar ease. In fact, I think it's probably even easier. So when we look at that, we're not completely sold on the top right quadrant is our go to quadrant for what options are the best. So we maybe need to think about according to our business goals, according to this project's goals, which ideal would bring us the most value to tackle first? Even if it's a little difficult, even if it's a little complex. Again, each of these will have votes on them to make it as easy as possible. Blue being impact or value, blue value, kind of easy to remember and ease being red.
An individual can vote, must vote with all their ideas. They must not share what they're voting on, and they can't trade actual dots or stickers so that one person doesn't influence at all. I like to have a rule of thumb that no individual can vote for more than three of a single color on a single post it. In order to explain that it's best to actually show a post it, which I don't have right here. Show a post it with the dots on it so that they'll know where their limits are. You can also keep an eye on everyone, just to make sure no one's trying to skew the vote in one direction or another. So the process is as follows. Get the ideas. Place them in an open space where you're easily able to move them around. Ask everyone to vote next to
the idea. Vote directly next to the idea, not on top of it. If you have a large group of individuals, there can be so many votes on an idea that you can't even read it. This allows you to easily count them and then take that exact post it and move it over to our prioritization grid. I found best practices. You allow the voting of the two different colors and then you write down. So for impact, 14 votes. For ease, we've got seven. So you have that for each idea, and then that makes it easier to actually line out. Some people might be very specific, like John, and need to have the exact measurements laid out so that it's easy to move the ideas in a grid form. This is just a simple, quick way to organize your ideas. Now, if you want to go an extra step, you can always divide up the ideas into, you know, your best bet, which I have terrible handwriting. Your best bet, your, you know, let's get it done soon, or keep focused on it. I like to think of this as the research category. How could we make it easier to do? How could we make it more impactful? And then probably your no go zone. So down here is your no go zone. It doesn't have impact. It's not really going to do anything good for us. So we'll leave those ideas to decide. We might need to research a little bit more, and since it's easiest, we could just pop in and do that one right away. Now, this is called many names the Eisenhower matrix, the impact effort grid, the prioritization grid. You can host it, you can go through it however you like. This is just the steps that I prefer to take so that it is as direct, straightforward and simple as possible. The two colored dots allow for a greater depth of understanding about what we're prioritizing. A lot of times people can get caught up on impact. What does impact mean? So impact just means value to the organization and value to the user. When we say easy, that's the how easy is it going to be for us to get the resources we need to get to the due date on time, to have everything at our fingertips so that we can actually complete the idea? So impact versus ease, that is impact over easy.
Exactly what you need to prioritize."
Knockout!,Medium,"5-12 participants per group, can have multiple groups.","At least 5 Post-its with preconceived ideas
from a previous brainstorming session.",10-20 minutes,"What is it? A head-to-head battle between every idea (top 8 ideas).
In this prioritization exercise, ideas will be compared and
prioritized in a “knockout” style form of voting. Important
to note: the facilitator plays a major role in guiding the
session smoothly. Line up your ideas, and get ready to
fight! Please don’t fight.",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732382/lectures/39187665 ,Before: Defining a path forward. After: Generating concepts or ideas.,"Now, if you were ever in middle school in America, you probably played the basketball game knockout where you line up on the free throw line. You have to shoot. The person behind you is shooting as fast as they can behind you. Sorry, I'm left handed. I'll do it right handed too. They're shooting as fast as they can behind you to try and knock you out of the game. In this prioritization exercise, the great, great advantage of it is that you will have a head to head between every idea that you have come up with. So I like to limit the pool of ideas to about eight. Otherwise it can be rather overwhelming. For this exercise, you just need your eight ideas or less ideas, a space to put them. It could be on the wall or it could be on flat on a table, and you line them up in one straight line like shown here. As you go through this, you can do it picking one single individual or asking the entire group. I prefer to ask the entire group. So we'll walk through it. You have all your ideas lined up in a single line on a flat surface. The order at this moment actually doesn't matter, but once we've gone through all the ideas, we will leave with a prioritized list of every idea versus every idea to show one true winner, one champion in the far square, which will be on the far left of whatever flat surface you have. So here are the rules, and I'm going to show you because it can get a little confusing. We'll start off with a head to head of concepts versus idea. When you start off, you're always going to want to start with the first idea on the right. We do that because as we progress through each idea, we'll know that this idea has already been used. So the unused idea on the right is the one we're going to start with. Are you confused yet? I'll keep going. So we'll start with concepts. Concepts will be in a head to head battle with idea. Now, crowd participants, is this idea more important than this concept? Yes or no? Let's discuss it. We'll have 1 minute to make a decision. Who would win in this head to head battle of importance of this idea? Well, it looks like concepts was not a winner. So concepts will stay to the right of the idea. It went head to head with an idea, will then be able to continue on forward. Now, the more ideas you have, the more overwhelming it can get. So I'm going to add a few more ideas so we can kind of walk through what a full round might look like. So concepts lost. We're going to restart the knockout rounds with the next idea in line from the right, which is idea. We're going to drop it below thought. Now, is this or this one more important? Well, it turns out ideas more important.
So, thought we'll go to the right. Idea will then move to left to battle the next idea. So is jacket or idea more important? Ah, looks like jacket's more important in this case. So we'll repeat that process of picking up an idea from the right that has not been discussed yet, battling all the way to the left until they lose, and then returning back to the next idea on the right that hasn't been used. So we'll continuously come back to the beginning. Have we used concepts? Yes. Have we used thought? Yes. Have we used idea? Yes. Which means this would be our final prioritization of jacket, idea, thought, and concepts. This allows you to go through every idea and know, as opposed to voting on a broad number of ideas. This is sort
of voting on just two ideas in a way. It's isolated voting on everything but super focused so that you are able to think of all the factors between what this thought brings to the table and what this concept brings to the table. Now, it does take more time because you're having more conversations watching it in action. It's very simple. One straight line of post its, one idea battling another. If it loses, it stays where it's at. If it wins, it continues progressing forward. This can take between 30 minutes all the way up to over an hour, depending on how many ideas and how in depth the conversations of those head to head knockout rounds go. It's full of conversation. It can get a little heavy if you let it go for longer than 30 minutes. I try and keep the number of participants to under seven just because the number of opinions can become overwhelming in the number of responses so long that you for sure will be in that conference room, that workshop space, for over an hour. That's knockout, and it can definitely hit all the ideas out of the way and leave you with a perfect prioritized list to turn into action items."
Pause for Applause,Easy,8-30 participants per group.,Some form of clapping or noise making for applause.,1-3 minutes,"Applause as a method of voting is not a perfect science,
but that doesn’t exactly matter. This informal method of
voting can be used to confirm the smaller decisions that
take place during a session. “Who wants to go to lunch
early?” ... pause for the applause! This type of voting gets
a rapid consensus and can help guide the group in the
right direction in a clap… a snap!",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732391/lectures/39188026,Before: Defining a path forward.  After: Generating concepts or ideas.,"Everybody knows how to do it. You were taught at a very young age, might not look that ridiculous, but you know how to applause. So does everybody else. It is easier to get a bunch of people to applause or make noise than it is to do the nonverbal one. However, if you have control of your environment and the people that are in it as a facilitator, you can get them to do either in this one. Applause as a way of voting is not a perfect science because some people are going to be super loud, some people are not. So this is when things don't exactly have to matter, right? So I'll give you a couple examples. Hey, do you want to push through and do a working lunch and leave home early or leave here early or do you want to stop, take a break, have an extended lunch, et cetera, get to know each other? We're going to do applause and I'm going to use the sound meter that's in my back pocket and based on how loud this gets is what we're going to do. So who wants to go to lunch early? Let's hear it. Round of applause. You have 3 seconds to make as much noise as you want. Ready, set, go. Then you do the other. Ready, set, go. Somewhat awkward if nobody yells, so you got to know your environment for this as well. But applause or snaps or yelling or animal noises, whatever you choose. This type of voting kind of gets a consensus very quickly. You can kind of understand if one person is making all the noise, but when everybody in the room is doing something, you know you're moving towards the right direction. This one is applause or making noise in some way, shape or form to vote."
Non Verbal,Easy,"5-15 participants, but can be more.
Be wary of “public math”.",Participants.,3-5 minutes,"One of the easiest ways to avoid an argument over what
they agree on or don’t. Employing Caesar’s (emperor, not
salad) thumb, this tool silently creates consensus. It also
forces the group to accept their biases by preventing
voting based on politics that exist in the room. Simple:
thumbs up or thumbs down",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732391/lectures/39188023,Before: Developing action items. After: Brainstorming concepts.,"I thought I would be funny if I said what this was non verbally. But this is non verbal voting. Take one. Non verbal voting, one of the easiest ways to prevent a whole bunch of people getting into an argument on what they agree on or what they disagree on, that there is. It entails kind of like the Caesar up or down thumb, and it happens at the exact same time so that people don't take other people's votes. Typically what will happen is if you're in the room with the manager or somebody that oversees you in some kind of way, shape or form, you wait to see what their vote is and then you kind of potentially vote. So if you don't really know where you're at and you see Johnny vote for something in the upwards way direction, you're going to give it the affirmative as well, because you're like, I don't really know, and then you do it. So nonverbal voting, you're going to prep the audience by saying, hey, listen, we're about to do some non verbal voting. That means no talking, please. And there's no talking for a reason. That reason is to prevent your ideas from jumping in the heads of other people before they vote. So nonverbal voting, you're going to hold your thumb out and vote in the upwards or downwards direction. Up means this and the ramifications are. Down means this, and the ramifications are you let them know exactly what's going on so that when everybody votes, they're ready to go and you're going to say, I'm going to count down, I'm going to go, three, two, one, vote. When I say vote, your hand has to be out. You need to be voting. And please don't wait to vote, or else your vote doesn't count. You know, you could do some like, hey, this is like cupcake wars. If the cupcakes is not out of the oven, it doesn't count. If your vote's not out, it doesn't count. Okay. Or you awkwardly put somebody on the spot and you say you didn't vote on time, what's your vote? I don't recommend doing that unless you know the individual or have had some kind of experience with them to see how they're going to act or react to that kind of prompt. But in the end, you're going to do quick math. Most people are not good at public math, including myself, very good at math, when nobody's watching, but nobody knows that because nobody actually is around me when I'm doing that math in public. If you look around and the overwhelming majority of people have their thumbs up or down, you know what to do. If it's split down the middle, take the time to count it. Go around and count every single one. And what you can do as a facilitator, you don't have to tell everybody what the votes are. You can say, okay, keep your votes visible and you just go around and you do this in your head and you count them out. You know how many people you have? You know how many you vote just counted. And if it teeters over the middle number, that's what you go with. Okay. Nonverbal voting. Nobody has to write anything down. You don't have to waste anything. And it's super quick once everybody does this one time and you establish the ground rules for what you want at any given time, you can ask for a vote after that in a group setting and you're going to get it right away. You're going to go, okay, hey, do we want to go to lunch right now or do we want a five minute break? Nonverbal voting."

more understanding. Let’s see what’s hot!",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732391/lectures/39187972,Before: Defining a path forward. After: Brainstorming potential solutions.,"Hot and cold. These are flames. In case you didn't know. There's a little line here that Johnny drew to let you know these are ice cubes. I don't know why he didn't label those. Probably because they look so cute and you know exactly what they are. Ice cubes, flames, hot, cold. It says zero to 100. You can make it any degree you want. You could use a Kelvin scale if you'd like. I don't even know those numbers, but you could. Hot and cold. The idea here is a way of voting to get everybody to put their idea where they think it ranks on the hot and cold scale. Now, there's no perfect science to this because some people that really love their ideas are going to say, oh man, that's hot. I'm going to put it up here. Some people are going to go, ah, yeah, I think it's okay. And they're going to kind of move around. Not very many people are going to say, my idea is cold, but what you can do is take a range of ideas that have all been thrown into the pot and have everybody grab an idea that's not theirs and rank it really quick. There's a lot of different ways that you can do this, but in the end you're going to wind up with a 60% solution with where they rank. Now, you can time box people at the end to say no. Two stickies can land at the exact same spot. So obviously you're going to need a bigger scale, most likely a really big wall. You can use horizontal instead of vertical if you'd like. In the end, you have to go, they can't match, they can't be on the same. So move the ones that are hotter, move the ones that are colder so that they kind of space out instead of clumped all towards hot or in the middle. Like it's a spectrum, let's move it out type of thing. So hot, cold, flames, ice cubes, you can do whatever you'd like. You can use whatever scale you like. The whole purpose is to get everybody to, to think, how good is my idea? How good are the ideas around me in relation to one another without taking a ton of time to get there? Now, being able to do that allows you to have some discussions around the things that landed over here. Potentially, if they're way down here, it prevents you from having a discussion at all. We don't even need to talk about these, but maybe you allow some people that had their ideas land here to give some amplifying information that not everybody knew. Hey, oh, by the way, did you know that we could accomplish this with fewer this, fewer that, and in a faster way, blah, blah, blah. And maybe you give them an opportunity to talk to the masses. Otherwise, you focus up here and you kind of pull those questions and thoughts from the group, from the things that land at the top. This is hot or cold. These are flames, in case you didn't know."

prioritization session.","Horse race. You've got a bunch of ideas. Now, I know these are pictures of horses, but imagine that's an idea. And that's an idea. And you get a car. And you get a car. No, these are ideas. Each one of these is its own idea. So imagine a group of five to seven people. They get together and they're trying to decide the best idea without, you know, stepping on anybody's toes. Instead of having a discussion and going through it. You can do a horse race. It's super fast. Once everybody understands how to do it, you can do it numerous times. It doesn't really get old because you can change the animal from a horse to anything. Chubby. Unicorn. Those are rhinos. Horse race. Now, this is what you do. Your idea is on the board. Everybody has an opportunity to move one, only one forward, a space. So imagine one sticky note space to the right. Ok. You can draw lines if you'd like. I left it clean so that you could use your imagination on how you want to do it. But imagine I can't move my own horse on the very first round. So there can be several rounds, but the very first round, you cannot move your own horse. So let's say we come up to this thing and Johnny moves my idea forward. I move Johnny's idea forward. Not because we have some kind of secret kind of pact or anything, but they're really good ideas. Susie moves this idea forward and then, let's say the last person, Brent, decides to move this one forward at a glance. You know, this horse is silly. It's going the wrong direction. Nobody voted for it. It was a bad idea. But you kind of cut it off. You go, hey, this one didn't even leave. Nobody thought it was good enough to proceed these move forward and then that one definitely moved forward. Right.
So by now you realize someone's going to move it once and then another person is going to go on top and move it again. That's okay. This could get all of the votes, right? So if the horse has started at the very beginning and it can't get all of them because you can't vote for your own, say the person that came up with this idea voted for this one, but the person that came up with this one moved it forward one. The person that came up with this moved it forward one. And wherever I'm at, moved it forward one. It's way out of the stable. It's already doing laps around everybody else. It's a horse race. Okay. That's the very first round of the horse race. This is where it gets interesting. The first time you could not pick your own, but now you start the horses back over of what's remaining, right? So we get rid of the idea that we didn't love. It's gone. We start the race again and we maybe give the one that had the absolute lead. Maybe we give them one extra. It's up to you, really. You could leave it the same. And now you can say you can vote for your own idea if you'd like. And you can see maybe how things have changed. Maybe Johnny votes for his own and doesn't vote for me. And maybe because I'm a nice guy, I voted for. Johnny's thinking he was going to vote for mine and he didn't, so his horse is way out there. Anyways. I've done this before, up to six rounds of a horse race to see how the horse go. You don't actually have to bring them all the way back and start over. You can keep the horses going depending on how much room you have. In the end, you visually see where the idea racks and sacks next to the others. It's also
kind of fun, especially if you choose different animals, et cetera. Remember, these are not cute little pictures of horses. Thanks, Johnny, for drawing these. These are ideas and potentially hopes and dreams of people that will get shattered by losing. But it's in a fun way, so hopefully they won't cry. This is horse race."

This is where you tell everyone, I want you to run around the room in the next 17 seconds and pair up with like minded people on exactly what you want to do moving forward. It's not the same as pick a corner, pick a side. Come over here in this group. Come over here in that group. The chaos is meant to ensue so that you can kind of pull from the room what's going on. You can see their body language. You can see the people that are really nervous. You can see the people that are really excited, and you can kind of flesh out the imbalance, potentially in those two different types of groups and the ones in between. So you say, you know, I said 17 seconds. This really depends on how many people you have, right? So if you've got 30 people, it's going to be really hard for them to group their ideas together in a meaningful way in 17 seconds. If you have five people, it's pretty quick, pretty easy, right? So I'd say with 30 people, I'd give them 90 seconds. 90 seconds total. Find people that agree with you and create groups. What you're going to notice is the people that speak a lot are going to go, my idea was the blah, blah, blah. Who agrees with that? And people are going to run over here and there's just. They're going to run all over the place. You can say, you can go stand next to your friend. It doesn't matter. Here's the point. In the end, you have the opportunity as a facilitator to ask anybody anything you want. Why are you in this group? Do you even know what group you're in right now? Did you follow somebody that you like? Did you follow somebody that you trust? And that's cool if you did. There's no shame in that, in admitting, hey, I followed this because I believe in him or her, and they've got a solid head on their shoulders. They know what they're doing. I'm willing to follow them anywhere they go, or no, I love this idea, etcetera. What you're going to find is sometimes those groups are duplicates. So you'll have one over here and one over here that are somewhat of the same idea, but it allows you to consolidate it in a very short amount of time without having to get everybody up to a wall or anything like that. Also, it's kind of like an icebreaker, where everybody just has to run around in pure and total chaos. Chaos has its place in a workshop. It can get the heart rate going. It can be used to read the room and the audience. It can be used to put people in an uncomfortable position.
Hey, let's embrace the discomfort here before we move on to the next thing, so that if you do something in the future that is also outside of their comfort zone, maybe it's not as far out as it would have been if they hadn't done this thing with you before. So this one is groupings. You do not have to make this pure and total chaos. You can follow the ones that we did before where it's like, hey, raise your hand if you want to go over here with this one. Raise your hand if you want to go over there with that one, etcetera. And methodically bring people where they need to go. This is based on your facilitation style, people in the room, and what you're attempting to get out of it. Groupings."

After: Brainstorming potential solutions.,"Finite numbers, percentages, for lack of a better title, for this voting strategy, you can use money numbers, percentages. You can use index cards or stacks of post its. You can use pretty cool little things where everybody gets to have a certain amount of money, etcetera. In the end, you're getting to the same goal. That is, you're giving everybody a bunch of different options to choose from, as opposed to just saying, I like this one, and here's why. Instead, you're saying, let's just say there are ten different items to choose from. You've given everybody enough to discard a few, so you give everybody seven votes, okay? And you know that they can vote for the same item four times, they can vote for the second item three times, et cetera, and that's it. They get to vote for two different things, et cetera, and you get to see how it plays out. My favorite example of this is 100%. You have 100%, and you need to devote that percentage however you'd like, across the spectrum. So you can vote for. I typically don't like to let everybody vote 100% of their thing towards one item if they really, really love it, but you can choose that on your own. I try to at least make that a third or 50% of it. So they would say, okay, 50% of my votes are going towards this one item, 20% are going towards this one, so on and so forth, et cetera. If you look online of different ways to use this method, there are countless examples. So I highly recommend that you choose one that works for your personality, for the outcome, for the people in the room, etcetera. But I think one thing that you're going to find that's pretty constant is the two thirds rule. And that rule is, it's not really a rule. That method is essentially making sure that they cut a third of the things that you can vote on out of the equation. Here are the third that we don't want or need, so that they can only vote even if they decided one per category, et cetera, that they haven't been able to vote on the other. The last third, they get to vote on two thirds of it, etcetera. So you can use this with money. Although if you do use money, I highly recommend that you make the money not tangible. So people aren't looking at $20 and going, well, that's really worth more like $2,000 or whatever. Even though that sounds very obvious to you and me, when you get in that setting, you are opening yourself up for people to draw parallels in real money to real value. Instead, put your own face on dollar bills or come up with your own type of game to allow people to spread it out. That's why I like percentages. It allows you to kind of pick and choose what you want. This one's easy to do online. In the in person scenario, you have to plan this one out. You can't just come into a workshop, decide, we're going to vote based on this method, and you haven't planned it, you haven't prepped it. There's nothing to pass out. You don't know where the bins or categories are, and you're not prepared. That is a recipe for a disaster, in my opinion. So for this one, I highly recommend that going into it, you know exactly how you're going to do it, where things are going to be, what you're going to call them, so that you can pass out the dollars, maybe even in the beginning of the workshop. And this is a really cool way to kind of put suspense into your workshop. You can go, hey, those dollars, don't take them out of your pocket. Don't give them to anybody else. We'll get to those later.
And everyone's like, well, what are we going to do? We're going to play games, is this monopoly? Et cetera, et cetera. Kind of keeps everything going a little bit. So play with this one. Start small, build up. And by starting small, I mean give everybody five votes and say, you can vote for this same object no more than twice or three times, and you have x number of things to vote on, ten things to vote on and see how that feels, and then kind of build off and make it bigger and more elaborate as you go. This one, for lack of a better title, is voting by numbers as a finite number or percentage."

We're gonna find you and take. No, I'm kidding. It's pretty, pretty bad. We can cut that out. Maybe not. So, dot voting. Everybody knows how to do it. You've probably done it before. But I'm going to demonstrate two different ways of doing dot voting that matter, depending on your personality and the people that you are leading through this workshop or meeting, etcetera, to get the best, most efficient, effective way of getting to that end solution, end goal with them. What? You're going to need dots. So the thing with these kind of dots, you can have big ones, small ones, you can have emoji looking dots. It really doesn't matter as long as everybody has the ability to vote. We like these because they have different colors, so they can mean different things. We really don't like something red, we absolutely love it. Green, this is like the best thing ever, maybe even better. Or blue, it's getting cold. Or yellow, let's have caution, whatever, right? You can come up with something that works for you, or emojis, et cetera. So you're going to have a bunch of things up here, some ideas, people are going to. Thank you, Johnny. I appreciate that. So you can have concepts and ideas and thoughts, and you'll be able to tell everybody, groups of five to seven in smaller groups or a really big board wall, et cetera, for 30 plus people, so that everybody kind of comes by and does it. So the two different ways to do it, one is anonymous, anonymous dot voting. Very, very hard to do in the moment if you haven't prepped it, so that people don't really know where they're going to go. Okay. You don't necessarily have to make it so that you don't see where everybody's at, but you give them almost no time whatsoever in order to vote. So you need enough room. That's what I meant by the prep. You need enough room where the ideas are spaced out. And then you tell everybody, hey, I'm going to give you, before you hand them this, I'm going to give you about five to ten minutes to review these, or, you know, I'm going to send you on a 15 minutes break. And during that break, I need you to spend at least five minutes on this board looking through ideas that you heard from the audience, etcetera. Okay? They come back, you hand them these and you tell them what they mean, and you say, I need you in less than 30 seconds to put these where you need to put them. Think about where you're going to put them. And when I say go, you'll do it. You wait. Give them like 30 seconds to think through it, and then you say, you only have 4 seconds to run up to the board and post your thing.
It is chaos. Hands are everywhere, etcetera. Be careful. People could get hurt or trampled. And also be careful with the proximity of individuals to each other, etcetera. They run up, they post it. It's a way of kind of like voting at the exact same time. You can't really base your idea on Johnny's because Johnny's already moved up and posted his and you don't have enough time to go over to the side and change your vote. So that's kind of the anonymous way of doing it. The other way is you basically just tell everybody to find their best. Maybe you give them three dots each and they can use those three dots however
they'd like. They can put three ideas on the exact same concept and their three dots are done, they're over with. Be careful. Don't give them a whole thing like this. Actually cut them out. So everybody has the exact same number that you're looking for, or they could, if it's a different person, they might vote one here and then two here. And depending on the number of ideas you have and the number of people, you're going to want to ramp up the number of dots that you have for the number of ideas, ramp them down for less numbers, et cetera. This can be done very, very quickly, and you can also completely anonymize it by having people go behind a wall and pass the vote to you to place them wherever you need to place them so that everybody has a visual of what everybody's looking at. It's really cool to look at a board of a ton of ideas and go, I notice a ton of red around this area. Why is that? We can have a discussion around it. I notice a ton of green around this area. Why is that? Let's dive into it. Why do we have caution over here, et cetera? It's just a way to fine tune your discussion and as a facilitator, fine tune the questions that you're going to ask everybody there and, and the prompting that you're going to need for the people that are in this workshop or meeting with you to get to a result that everybody can high five at the end or high elbow each other in agreement. Hey, we, at least we're sort of on the same page. Let's move forward as opposed to I don't want to do this, but I'm going to do it because my boss said that I had to type of thing. So this one voting. You can change this to make this your own however you'd like. You can have them draw little things. They can not use dots. They can draw an image of whatever they want and post it next to the one that they like the most. It's really up to you. Have a ball."

particular demographic? A great launching point for a
quick discussion before moving on.",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732391/lectures/39187965,"Before: Developing an action plan or in-depth
research. After: Sharing ideas or concerns around a topic.","This is a way. This is a way to vote non verbally, without applause, and with a bunch of buckets. You don't need buckets. In fact, the very first few years that I did this, I did it with cardboard lying around. And in fact, you can just do it with sections of tables. You can tape off areas of a room or a corner where people throw votes in, etcetera. A vote is simply a post it note. They don't even have to write anything on that post it note. And each bin or bucket or area that you have is underneath something that you've designated. So you designate this as option a, B, C, D, etcetera. And you tell everybody what the options are. You allow them enough time to go around and truly study those. I try not to do this one super quick. I try to give everybody enough time, and I usually bake it in with a break. So I say, instead of a ten minute break, I might say, hey, you have a 13 minutes break. But when we start back, I need you to have voted on one of these things. Simply walk around, take a sticky and throw it into one of these bins. You can only use one. Now, there are some definite flaws to this one, because if somebody really wants to be malicious, they can throw a couple. I try to stay in the room to kind of make sure that everybody's being fair, etcetera. Also, you can see where other people vote. So those are the drawbacks. You can get around those by putting these buckets behind a wall, like a whiteboard or something like that. So everybody has to leave on their way out and drop something into the top of a cardboard cutout or something like that, or put something into the bin, or you're behind the wall and you're able to throw them where they want, or you collect them and. And they say, I want this for option a or b, or they point to it and you put it there anyways. The whole point is, in the end, it's the quantity of post its that matter in those categories. You count them up, they come back from break and you're able to say, hey, option b has it. We had eight out of 16, but the other ones only amounted to two or three. So same thing as the other voting applies. You lead this into a discussion unless it's absolutely overwhelming or you don't have all of the information that you need to make that decision moving forward. So you ask the people that, quote unquote, lost, why is it that you think that this should not take place? Or why should we not do this, etcetera, and allow a little bit of discussion to take place. This one is bins to buckets. Buckets are more fun. Cardboard works. It really doesn't matter. This is all about getting a consensus from the group to kind of move forward."
