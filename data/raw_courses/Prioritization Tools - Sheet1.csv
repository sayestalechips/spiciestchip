Doesn't matter what it's called. Doesn't matter what you call it. The purpose of this is to get everybody to consolidate where they think their idea lands or others on a range. This is bullseye. Right? We are. We're crushing it. This idea is going to solve and boil the ocean today. This one is really good and might help us start that process. This one is okay. And maybe we should still talk about it. Anything on the fringes is like, this idea is so bad, it's not even worth opening our mouth to talk about at all, period. Right? And what you can do is you have everybody take their ideas as they're going, or after the fact, it's up to you, and place them where they think they belong. The bigger the bullseye, the more space you have. And here's a cool thing. So let's say a bunch land right here, right in the middle. You can tell them, hey, I only want two to land in the bullseye. So you all have to discuss amongst yourselves where these go. Is this one now going to come out to the fringes? And this one will come out here. Like, how are you going to do that? So that's going to spark discussion, etcetera. I've also seen this before where, let's say you have a group of five people. Actually, I can't cut a pie in five without looking really dumb, so I'm going to break it into four. Let's say you have four people. You could break this into fours and you could have everybody have their own slice, right? So you put your own ideas where you think they land in your own pie, of how they rack and stack to each other. Not all your ideas are going to be perfect. And if they are, maybe you have a personality issue with somebody in your group. Unless they're just amazing. If Johnny's in your group, maybe you don't have a personality issue. Maybe the eyes are deal. The ideas are just good tongue twisted there so they can rack and sack them on their own, in their own pie, and then you can have the discussion. Well, hey, I put one or two here.
You put one or two here. They're the same, or maybe they're different. And here's why, etcetera. Again, this is a visual way of seeing where everybody lands so that you can zero in and focus. Focus on what's important and where to bring the conversation and discussion moving forward."
Impact over Easy,Easy,"3-10 participants per group, as
many groups as needed.","Concepts from a previous brainstorming activity, a
flipchart with the Impact Effort Matrix drawn, dot
stickers.",10-15 minutes,"What is it? Brainstorming is the easy part. Finding a path forward…
not so much. This tool provides a simple matrix to allow
for the rapid voting and ranking of opportunities based
on two simple factors: How much impact will this concept
have? How easy is it to get done?",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732382/lectures/39187663 ,"Before: Developing action items After: Brainstorming concepts (problems,
stakeholders, or solutions).","Impact over easy. Exactly what you need in order to prioritize your ideas. It can be used for problems. I prefer to use it on ideas exclusively. What you'll need is a flip chart, a stack full of ideas. Your participants who hopefully created those ideas. It's best done with, well, it can be an unlimited number because you are going to need voting. You're going to need dots, which John will bring me some dots momentarily. So, to get this started, we're actually just going to draw out a simple grid. We're going to have impact on one side and we're going to have ease on the other. As you can see, higher up, meaning the more votes for the idea with our blue sticky, I mean our blue dot sticker, sticker, sticky and sticker. Our blue dot sticker will increase the impact in the red. The more dots of red we have on an idea, the more easy, the easier it will be to complete that idea. So, as you can see, I have a handful of ideas here below on this chart. Our goal is actually just to map out which ideas are both impactful and easy to be completed. This is the sweet spot area. That's where our best ideas will be located. Simple enough. So what you do is draw this map, show all the ideas to make sure all the individuals understand what ideas are available to vote on. Everyone. All individuals can vote on any ideas. I like to give, depending on the number of participants, three to five votes to each individual of each color. That's three to five blue and three to five red. Make sure that's the same exact number for both. So if we were to have, say, make an online course, that could be impactful. But it is not easy. Trust me, I'm doing it right now. Or we could get matching tattoos. That would be easy, maybe. No, it would probably be hard to convince John and it wouldn't be impactful. So that's probably going to be our lowest idea. We could host a meetup that would be relatively easy but not so impactful. We could write a book that's pretty difficult and maybe a little less impactful depending on how well we write it. Or we could do a podcast, which I'd say similar impact, similar ease. In fact, I think it's probably even easier. So when we look at that, we're not completely sold on the top right quadrant is our go to quadrant for what options are the best. So we maybe need to think about according to our business goals, according to this project's goals, which ideal would bring us the most value to tackle first? Even if it's a little difficult, even if it's a little complex. Again, each of these will have votes on them to make it as easy as possible. Blue being impact or value, blue value, kind of easy to remember and ease being red.
An individual can vote, must vote with all their ideas. They must not share what they're voting on, and they can't trade actual dots or stickers so that one person doesn't influence at all. I like to have a rule of thumb that no individual can vote for more than three of a single color on a single post it. In order to explain that it's best to actually show a post it, which I don't have right here. Show a post it with the dots on it so that they'll know where their limits are. You can also keep an eye on everyone, just to make sure no one's trying to skew the vote in one direction or another. So the process is as follows. Get the ideas. Place them in an open space where you're easily able to move them around. Ask everyone to vote next to
the idea. Vote directly next to the idea, not on top of it. If you have a large group of individuals, there can be so many votes on an idea that you can't even read it. This allows you to easily count them and then take that exact post it and move it over to our prioritization grid. I found best practices. You allow the voting of the two different colors and then you write down. So for impact, 14 votes. For ease, we've got seven. So you have that for each idea, and then that makes it easier to actually line out. Some people might be very specific, like John, and need to have the exact measurements laid out so that it's easy to move the ideas in a grid form. This is just a simple, quick way to organize your ideas. Now, if you want to go an extra step, you can always divide up the ideas into, you know, your best bet, which I have terrible handwriting. Your best bet, your, you know, let's get it done soon, or keep focused on it. I like to think of this as the research category. How could we make it easier to do? How could we make it more impactful? And then probably your no go zone. So down here is your no go zone. It doesn't have impact. It's not really going to do anything good for us. So we'll leave those ideas to decide. We might need to research a little bit more, and since it's easiest, we could just pop in and do that one right away. Now, this is called many names the Eisenhower matrix, the impact effort grid, the prioritization grid. You can host it, you can go through it however you like. This is just the steps that I prefer to take so that it is as direct, straightforward and simple as possible. The two colored dots allow for a greater depth of understanding about what we're prioritizing. A lot of times people can get caught up on impact. What does impact mean? So impact just means value to the organization and value to the user. When we say easy, that's the how easy is it going to be for us to get the resources we need to get to the due date on time, to have everything at our fingertips so that we can actually complete the idea? So impact versus ease, that is impact over easy.
Exactly what you need to prioritize."
Knockout!,Medium,"5-12 participants per group, can have multiple groups.","At least 5 Post-its with preconceived ideas
from a previous brainstorming session.",10-20 minutes,"What is it? A head-to-head battle between every idea (top 8 ideas).
In this prioritization exercise, ideas will be compared and
prioritized in a “knockout” style form of voting. Important
to note: the facilitator plays a major role in guiding the
session smoothly. Line up your ideas, and get ready to
fight! Please don’t fight.",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732382/lectures/39187665 ,Before: Defining a path forward. After: Generating concepts or ideas.,"Now, if you were ever in middle school in America, you probably played the basketball game knockout where you line up on the free throw line. You have to shoot. The person behind you is shooting as fast as they can behind you. Sorry, I'm left handed. I'll do it right handed too. They're shooting as fast as they can behind you to try and knock you out of the game. In this prioritization exercise, the great, great advantage of it is that you will have a head to head between every idea that you have come up with. So I like to limit the pool of ideas to about eight. Otherwise it can be rather overwhelming. For this exercise, you just need your eight ideas or less ideas, a space to put them. It could be on the wall or it could be on flat on a table, and you line them up in one straight line like shown here. As you go through this, you can do it picking one single individual or asking the entire group. I prefer to ask the entire group. So we'll walk through it. You have all your ideas lined up in a single line on a flat surface. The order at this moment actually doesn't matter, but once we've gone through all the ideas, we will leave with a prioritized list of every idea versus every idea to show one true winner, one champion in the far square, which will be on the far left of whatever flat surface you have. So here are the rules, and I'm going to show you because it can get a little confusing. We'll start off with a head to head of concepts versus idea. When you start off, you're always going to want to start with the first idea on the right. We do that because as we progress through each idea, we'll know that this idea has already been used. So the unused idea on the right is the one we're going to start with. Are you confused yet? I'll keep going. So we'll start with concepts. Concepts will be in a head to head battle with idea. Now, crowd participants, is this idea more important than this concept? Yes or no? Let's discuss it. We'll have 1 minute to make a decision. Who would win in this head to head battle of importance of this idea? Well, it looks like concepts was not a winner. So concepts will stay to the right of the idea. It went head to head with an idea, will then be able to continue on forward. Now, the more ideas you have, the more overwhelming it can get. So I'm going to add a few more ideas so we can kind of walk through what a full round might look like. So concepts lost. We're going to restart the knockout rounds with the next idea in line from the right, which is idea. We're going to drop it below thought. Now, is this or this one more important? Well, it turns out ideas more important.
So, thought we'll go to the right. Idea will then move to left to battle the next idea. So is jacket or idea more important? Ah, looks like jacket's more important in this case. So we'll repeat that process of picking up an idea from the right that has not been discussed yet, battling all the way to the left until they lose, and then returning back to the next idea on the right that hasn't been used. So we'll continuously come back to the beginning. Have we used concepts? Yes. Have we used thought? Yes. Have we used idea? Yes. Which means this would be our final prioritization of jacket, idea, thought, and concepts. This allows you to go through every idea and know, as opposed to voting on a broad number of ideas. This is sort
of voting on just two ideas in a way. It's isolated voting on everything but super focused so that you are able to think of all the factors between what this thought brings to the table and what this concept brings to the table. Now, it does take more time because you're having more conversations watching it in action. It's very simple. One straight line of post its, one idea battling another. If it loses, it stays where it's at. If it wins, it continues progressing forward. This can take between 30 minutes all the way up to over an hour, depending on how many ideas and how in depth the conversations of those head to head knockout rounds go. It's full of conversation. It can get a little heavy if you let it go for longer than 30 minutes. I try and keep the number of participants to under seven just because the number of opinions can become overwhelming in the number of responses so long that you for sure will be in that conference room, that workshop space, for over an hour. That's knockout, and it can definitely hit all the ideas out of the way and leave you with a perfect prioritized list to turn into action items."
Moscow Tool,Easy,"5-7 participants per group, unlimited number of groups.","Flip chart or whiteboard, ideas from a previous
round of brainstorming (copied on new Post-its).",15-30 minutes,"What is it? An acronym for Must Have, Should Have, Could Have,
Won’t Have, this prioritization tool gets straight to the
core of the discussion. Dividing a flip chart into four
sections, the group is tasked with separating concepts
into concrete decisions.",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732382/lectures/39187668. ,"Before: developing action items and next steps. After: Brainstormings concepts (problems, stakeholders, or solutions).","Moscow tool drinking your way to priorities Moscow tool is a simple process for prioritizing the different sections of an idea, a specific idea, or overall all the ideas and options you have at hand. Great for doing ideas, not as great for using to identify what problem we should focus on. So definitely use it towards the end of the session. Works best for five to seven participants per flip chart. I'd recommend trying to keep it to that. If you have multiple Moscows going on around the room around the same idea or the same series of ideas, you might get different results. It does provide a good discussion point, but it also can kind of cause chaos and misalignment amongst the entire team. So try and keep this to smaller groups in my experience. Now here's how you do it. Moscow, as you can see, is a simple acronym. Must have, should have, could have, won't have. Now, when we're going to break down the idea, this can help us get action items as well. What you're going to want to do is follow the numbers I have here on the board, starting with must have. Our must haves are skeleton mode. Our must haves are the things that keep the body of our idea in place. They are the base level, the function that we need in order to actually complete the most basic version of the idea. While it's not beautiful, it is able to work and run. So that's why must have cannot be excluded these ideas. Now, if we have multiple ideas already written out, these ideas must be done in order for us to have any progress at all. They must be done first. Anything that has a dependency on it can be done later in a section that we would call should have. So when I say something extra, I mean it's not fundamental for the immediate success or functionality or completion of the idea, but it is needed in order to enhance the idea and make it worthwhile. While this gets the idea up and running, this makes it slightly prettier or slightly easier to use in the third section. The could have third section down here, but it is the last one you will do. Remember, the order is start with the must haves because that's the easiest for everyone to get aligned on and also the most important. Then you can jump to the won't haves, meaning we will not add this into the idea or we will not do this step. That just helps kind of divide the group of ideas a lot faster, a lot simpler than trying to go one by one across it. This process of extremes allows the ideas to kind of be put into two categories, and then from there separated into the four should have and could have definitely take a lot more effort and a lot more time. They can get a little frustrating for some individuals who are leaning in one direction or the other. I think if there's any controversy over an idea and it is going on for a very long time, I tend to leave it one step back. So if we're discussing should it be a must have or should have, which is a very important category, I tend to lean towards the should have. If it isn't exactly fundamental to the official original success of the product project that is at hand, I just try and say, all right, if it's not going to break it, let's leave it in the should have and we'll get to it. Just immediately after we get that base level built up or completed, that part of the project. Now in the won't have. Again, that's the no go. These things can be parked for now. That doesn't mean never will we do them. But at this moment in time, it's not necessary, it's not
impactful to do so. It's just not worthwhile. We're not at that phase where we need to be in order to actually be able to do that.
We don't have the resources, the time, maybe we don't have the know how or the infrastructure set up yet. So all good excuses to tell the participants when you put some of their ideas in the won't have. So I'm going to repeat everything in a quick summary. The Moscow tool is just this simple process for separating either with within an individual idea what we should and shouldn't do, essentially, and the order of operations of how we're going to do it, or if it's a series of ideas, we can separate them. So we know, okay, this year, the projects that we're going to work on, well, we must work on these in order to actually continue towards our business strategy and goal. We should tackle these next because they're going to enhance our initial efforts. And if we have the time and resources, we could have these things done or these projects completed because it would make an even larger impact, kind of snowball effect. And these guys, although there are incredible ideas, we're going to hold off on them for now. And that is the Moscow tool. Simply put, I like to do it towards the end of a workshop, after we've had deep discussions, after we've talked about ideas. You can also do it at the beginning of a fiscal year. If you are thinking about the different projects that you want to tackle throughout the year. At the beginning of a project, if you already have these concepts kind of whittled down, you do want to have a focus. So you do want to have either a problem or a solution that you're trying to tackle to start with. Moscow tool enjoy with the twist of line."

After: Brainstormings concepts (problems, stakeholders, or solutions).","When you've had enough of stuff not being prioritized, then chaos happening amongst your participants. You've got ideas, but you don't know where to go from there. From there, how do you figure out which one's next? That's when the nuff test will come super handy for you and your participants. Now, it's a simple exercise for prioritizing ideas based on three factors, new, useful, and feasible. That'll spell enough for you. So in order to set up the exercise, you will need a few things. You'll need different colored post its. Simple. You'll also need a handful of ideas that are the core ideas that you're trying to figure out which one needs to actually happen. Right now it's great for breaking down ideas. This isn't to throw out ideas, but it is to see the weak points of specific ideas and the strong points of others. It's simple, it's organized, and it can be done pretty quickly, in about 15 to 20 minutes if you are prepared correctly. As always, I like to do everything in a group of five to seven. That just allows everybody have the opportunity to talk, discuss and share comfortably. If you are in a group that's a bit larger, I would set up two identical maps or flip charts with the tool already drawn on them, with the ideas already written, so that everybody's discussing the same talking points and then comparing and contrasting the two different groups and allowing them to kind of discuss why one has a higher score than another. So, to continue to explain, I have an example to my right. I'm going to go over the categories first and then we'll talk about the idea. So, new newness of the idea means how novel would it be? Has this been done before? Is this a common idea or is it completely original? Useful. Exactly that. How useful is this idea to us and to our user? Both aspects combined into one feasible. Given our resources, given our experience and our knowledge, are we able to actually get this idea done? How complex would it be? So the more feasible, the easier it is to do so we're going to score every one out of ten. So each individual category is a score out of ten, which we total up at the end, as you can see here. I'm going to dive into the example. The idea we have is called shock socks. Socks that are so fluffy that when you walk around like this, they give you a nice static electricity so you can shock whoever you want. Pretty fun idea, right? So how new is that? Well, I've never seen socks that are intentionally designed to give you static electricity, it's probably not a great idea, but it is a new idea. How useful is it? Not very honestly, other than messing around and shocking people, it's an idea that's not useful at all. How feasible is it? Well, because we already know the science of static electricity and because we know certain materials give us more electric vibes, it's actually pretty feasible. So what I like to do to get to these numbers is actually ask the group, okay, how new is this idea?
And get a little discussion going around the idea. If people aren't comfortable with just shouting out a number and trying to land on an agreed upon number, what you can do is have everybody individually write it down, have a space for you to put all those numbers. You could do the median of those numbers, you can average them. You can also just based
on what you see, go with your gut, a gut check and write down a number yourself and slap it up there. After you do that, you put up the number that you've decided based on what everyone has answered and say, hey, does seven sound like the right number? And then see if there's a big reaction. If there's a small reaction, then I would just leave it. If it's a big. Whoa, whoa, whoa. That's not high enough for whoa. That's a way, way higher than I expected. Remove it calmly and say, okay, well, then walk me through why it needs to be a little lower and let's see if we can come to a quick consensus on this. So 15 to 20 minutes can depend on the number of ideas you're trying to break down. I recommend never putting more than five ideas on enough test because visually and mentally it can be a bit overwhelming. You also really should only be focusing in on about three ideas. That's quick, that's easy to decipher and allows for deeper discussions. So I'm going to walk you through the second one. YouTube videos of socks would be the concept. How new is that? Well, everybody's done YouTube videos and I'm sure there's a whole world wide web on the line of sock videos. Useful. Well, it could get us some promotion, it could get some attention. So I'm going to put it at a three because of that. How feasible is it, man, we already got the camera, we already got some socks on our feet. We can do that right now. That's very feasible. So, as you can see, based on the two ideas we've discussed, the shock socks are still the winner at the moment. We know some weak points as far as the YouTube videos if we can figure out a way to make those videos more unique, potentially the value will go up. That's the great thing about this exercise. If you notice one idea that had a lot of potential actually scores low, you can discuss the reasons why it ended up being lower and see if there's a way to enhance it. So the idea itself is continuously iterating. It calls you out on your own bluff, or on your own concept, or on the gap of knowledge you have within a certain sector. The nuff test can be done one more time in 15 to 20 minutes. I like to do it with five to seven participants or a sister team of five to seven participants. That would total up to ten to 14 total within the group. Easy. Everyone just needs to be circled around a visible area where you can show this. You also need to come prepared with a handful of ideas. Whether this is at the end of a workshop and you already have a quick snapshot of, these are the five ideas we're trying to actually break down. Or if you just come to a head to head where you can't figure out of the ideas that you've already prioritized, which one of the two or three ideas you have actually needs to get done.
This is a simple exercise just to decipher between that and also break down into simple categories the value behind each section so you can piece that together into a presentation after the fact. And I guess that's probably enough said for the NUF test."

After: Sharing ideas or concerns around a topic," Prioritrees. It helps you grow into some priorities. So following a brainstorming exercise, you're going to want to use priorities to organize those initial thoughts. Maybe you did a leaf pile, which is another exercise we have, and just have a big fat stack of wonderful ideas. Now you need to convert them into an organized pattern and figure out which ones are better opportunities than the next. To do that, all you need is a priority. So again, you'll need to have a stack of our a stack of ideas already created before you use this exercise. This is for prioritizing. Now draw on a whiteboard or a flip chart like I have here, a simple tree. So we know the core of the tree will be the most important idea. So put the most important ideas as close to the trunk as possible. And I like to draw three branches to start off. Each branch will represent a category of ideas. Maybe. As you can see here, I've already grouped some of the ideas, but so maybe we have blue, green, and pink. As an, as some ideas, we know those are similar ideas for some reason. Pink is the most important. Green is the least important. I know. Shirt, jacket, shorts. So as you can see, as we go sharing the ideas, we can start to categorize them. The way I prefer to share, because it helps do this in a very organized process, is after everyone has their ideas in that brainstorming session, they hold onto them, and I pick one individual to go through all their ideas. First they share, they pause, they wait to see if anybody has a similar idea, and then they continue on. So you don't want to overwhelm everything by making too many branches either. So try and find maybe four or five branches, common categories of ideas that you can organize in. So the first individual will share through all their post its, placing them on various branches. And if some ideas are a little too crazy, we can say they're just kind of hanging out. Maybe the leaves are falling a little bit, or maybe we put them at the top of the tree for now, until we kind of can boil that down into a more concrete category. Again, the ideas are in order of importance, so the closer to the core trunk, the more important. The farther away, the less important. Allow the individuals to all go up on their own. Start adding those as they add them to the board. In that process of sharing, you'll notice the tree becomes fuller and fuller. A lot of the ideas may be very similar. If the idea is exactly the same, stack one on top of the other. If they're very similar, they'll just go right next to each other we'll notice that the tree becomes more and more full until it may be time to shake the branches a bit. So after everyone shared their ideas, after you have them categorized, one thing you can do is actually write a name of a category. Name the branch so that from a far distance, if your participants are seated, or if you just take a quick snapshot of the photo, everyone has an initial instant understanding of what each branch is talking about. So once you have all those ideas, you can shake the branches by saying, okay, guys, it's time to kind of shake things loose, because this tree is way weighing down. It's got too many leaves.
The branches are going to fall off and won't be able to do anything at all. So let's see, if we shook the tree, which leaves would fall off? Because they're not hanging on, they're not as
intensely important as the rest, right? They're not full of life as the other one. So when we shake the tree, maybe a few post its will fall off and we realize one or two are more important than the rest. We can use this to get a quick snapshot of our own power to prioritized ideas, the categories they fall into and then dive into deeper discussion. This is just, again, kind of a gut check. A quick look at what the prioritization might lay out to be, and then we can move on to break these down into action items, into actual steps to make concrete, tangible results. And that's prioritrees rooting for you. Tree punishment."

Group the participants and allow them to select the idea they want to build or simply assign it. Remember, you need to start off with those prioritized ideas. Next, you're going to have to prep a handful of completely white boxes, and you're going to task them with the following. Now imagine if your idea was sold in a department store. We're going to design the packaging that it comes in. It's a simple box that you have to fill out each side in order to actually describe it. So a customer can pick it up, look at it, and learn everything they need to know about it before deciding whether or not they need it. I have made, and because I'm terrible at wrapping, I have made a box here myself. So we're going to start off with the first and most easy, well, the easiest side to do, which is naming of the box and coming up with a slogan. So you will name your idea and come up with a slogan about it. Next, you're going to write the key benefits of that idea. Why is this idea valuable on the other side? Boop. Of course we're going to say how to use it. Are there requirements for using it? Are there requirements on our end for making it? And of course, on the back we've got this definition of the customer type. This can be actually a Persona that you fill out. But who is this product for? Simple, straightforward. If you want to get even farther into conversation, you can ask them to describe what they would fill the box with. That can be the context of the idea itself, the detailed description of the idea. That can be what's inside of it. Easy to do. If there are other factors, like an expiration date, you can put that on top of when the idea or project should be completed. It's a simple, straightforward exercise, which I love, that allows all individuals to get excited, get creative, and really well define their idea. After each group is finished, I like to give them 20 to 30 minutes to really try and decorate this thing as incredible as possible. I'll have colored markers, stickers, everything you can imagine for an intense arts and crafts adventure to build these boxes. Now, the best boxes you can probably find are going to be at your common FedEx store. Walmart has some really cheap options for less than a dollar not to give them a sponsorship, but we haven't given out a sponsorship in a while. A little shout out. So after each group finishes their boxes, maybe 20 to 25 minutes in. I like to give each group two minutes max two and a half minutes to share their ideas. We'll set up like a stage and they'll have a pitch where they describe the box, they tell each side of it, and they walk through what it actually is and how they're going to get it done. After each group goes well, hopefully they'll have fans of their idea.
I allow for an applause session at the end for each idea for voting. Or you can actually do the bucket approach, which is mentioned in another video where you vote by simply dropping your post it into a bucket underneath the idea they like the most. While everyone is sharing.
An interesting extra that you can do for your participants is ask them all to take notes on the ideas, track what they liked about each, and how they could add it onto their own concepts. This is kind of a middle ground of ideas in the process of brainstorming. So you have a defined idea, a defined product, but it allows you to continue enhancing it by stealing from the concepts of others in the room. And since we're all in one organization, building a better overall project, process or product, or maybe even even a person, and that is the product box can be called the cereal game. It is entirely too fun to end a workshop, so I highly recommend it."
Triangle Triage,Medium,"3-10 participants per group, can be multiple groups.","Post-its & Sharpies for each participant, space
to demonstrate Triangle Triage.",15-25 minutes,"What is it? User-Solution-Problem. This tool calls upon the expertise
and experience of each individual in the room. With each
participant completing the same template/process, the
group can compare the thoughts of many, identify issues,
and align on common ground. Get a pulse of everyone in
the room and uncover the core concerns early.",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732382/lectures/39187672,"Before: Brainstorming solutions, get more context. After: An introduction to the session.","For this exercise, all you need is a sharpie. Sticky notes for everybody. For the masses. You do not need this. This is just for demonstration purposes. You can, however, use a chalkboard, a white board, you know, a sticky note, a piece of paper. It doesn't matter. Just so you can show everybody what you're going to do, everybody is going to think through this exercise kind of the way that, the way that I show you here, but on their sticky note. Okay, so they're all going to draw a triangle, circle at the top and circle at the sides. Okay, this is a user. This user leverages or uses leverages or uses this solution to solve or improve this problem that the user has. Okay, there's a reason that I don't have this pre done beforehand, because it's a lot. If you just say, this user leverages or uses this solution to solve this problem. Cool, you got it. Go do it. Instead. I slow it down. I write it out. Everyone's kind of confused that I'm going slow, and then I kind of dissect it. Okay, everybody is going to do this on their own post it note, and I go ahead and tell them, so what of this exercise, before we even start, so that they're not confused or they at least have some kind of goal in mind of where they're going to go. Right in the end, instead of me going around this room and saying, what do you think our problems are and what do you think potential solutions are and who are we solving this problem for and what's the root cause and et cetera, et cetera. Instead, everyone's going to write one. We're going to share it in about 15 to 20 seconds each. And in the very beginning of this workshop, we're going to have a very good pulse on where everybody is in the room. And here's the so what. Even beyond the so what is, if everybody writes it in the very beginning, you can't really change it. So hearing from Fred or Susan or Catherine, when it gets to Johnny, Johnny has not rewritten his original thoughts based on their thoughts. These are all raw and organic thoughts and problem sets before everybody kind of dives in. So that's why it's so valuable for this pulse. Right? So you say start with the user. Are you thinking about yourself? Are you thinking about the organization as a whole? Are you thinking about a specific person within a team, a specific team, a department, et cetera? That is the user. So take the time to think about what you want to get out of today. Right. They're going to have some kind of idea of what you're doing for the day leading into this. Anyways, they had emails and invites to be here. Hopefully you've given some kind of introduction.
So what is the user for today for you? Right. What are they going to leverage? What are they going to use? So this solution that you're coming up with, there is a reason that we write solution and then problem. We don't just say, this user has this problem and they're going to use this solution to solve it. Instead, you start with the solution and it's a mind shift from we've got these problems and, yeah, we're going to solve it. Check out the hook while my dj revolves it. And I'm kidding. Instead you start out of the positive. You say, we've got this solution or we've got this idea. It doesn't even have to be good. It's just something that improves the user's experience towards this problem. That's why it's a triangle, because you
can kind of go backwards. This user has this problem and we use this solution to solve it for the user. Right. This is done this way. Just because it's clockwise, it actually makes sense this way. And it starts you off with a positive mindset for the day. Instead of saying, here are our problems, this is our solution. I've said that before. I want to make sure that it's locked in for you, this user. This is the last time this user leverages or uses or whatever word you want to use this solution. Right. You're going to write this solution to solve this problem. Everybody writes it. You give everybody. I'd give everybody about three minutes to really think through this. I wouldn't go more than five and I wouldn't go less than three. It's the perfect amount of awkward time where the people that have it right away, they've got it and that's great. And you're not going to waste a lot of their time. The people that don't, you've given them a chance to really do it. You are going to ask everybody to say this out loud. So if you have, I'd say, more than 25, 30 people, I'd recommend breaking up into big groups. Right. You split the group, 15 over here, 15 over there, or however many more you have, just because you're going to end up taking a lot of time out of everybody. You do not have to do this for an entire group of people. You can do it in subgroups. So you explore and then they go to the breakout group that they're going to use for the remainder of the day or the exercise or the workshop. And so they get a little bit more of a taste of what each other are thinking before they dive in and kind of get to know each other a little bit more, potentially, depending on where you put this.
Right. Again, very, very quick way to get the pulse of the room allows you to put these off to the side after the fact so that you can revisit it at the end of the workshop and go, did we solve any of these problems? What were our problems? Did we get to the root cause of what we said in the beginning of this workshop? Were our users the same, or are we off all over the map on what we think we need to do together? This is usually followed by a very meaningful discussion because everyone is going to hear all these things. They can take notes, you can prompt them. Please take notes while you're listening to everybody, so that when the time comes for us to have our discussion, you can, you know, point out key aspects of what people said, the discussion afterwards. The meaningful discussion is very, very powerful and made better by having all of these kind of on the board or in the pockets of everybody to bring out after a break or something like that. This is triangle triage."
