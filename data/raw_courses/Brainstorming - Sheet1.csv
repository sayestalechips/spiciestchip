Brainwriting,Medium,"5-7 participants per group, can have multiple groups","10-15 mins, depending on efficiency of brainstorming","A tactic for rapidly generating lots and lots of ideas by creating a time-crunch and encouraging “yes-and” thinking. “Yes-and” thinking is easy: after hearing or writing an idea, simply try to add onto that existing concept to plus it up or create something new. Do not put down the idea. Think improv! Grab paper, pens, and a stopwatch. It’s time to stretch the mind!When to use it: Before: Prioritizing solutions After: Identifying hte problem or topic of focus
Number of Participants 5 - 7 participants in agroup seated at a table.
Materials:Sheet of paper folded into equal rectangles, sharpies for each participant. Best to prep an example pre-workshop.
What is it? A pressure cooker of an ideation process, this exercise consists of timeboxed windows of
brainstorming and rapid collaboration. Participants will create an initial idea before chaos creates diamonds.
Using the concepts of others and the pressure of time, participants will generate 8 fresh concepts in less than 8 minutes. Filter-free innovation!",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732284/lectures/39185862," Brainwriting is a supercharged, super energetic, sort of energy demanding brainstorming exercise to create as many ideas as possible in a time boxed window. So, here is what you need. All your participants are going to need is a sheet of a one standard white paper and they're going to need something to write with.
I prefer sharpies. Pens are hard to see and kind of confuse people. So I'm going to recommend a Sharpie. In order to do this exercise, you need everybody to fold their paper once in half. I think that's called hamburger.
And then repeat that, folding it in half again so that you have a double folded. I'm going to show that one more time. So we folded it in half, I folded that half long ways in half again and then I'm going to stand it up tall and make eight equal rectangles is the goal of all this folding eight equal rectangles.
Now, in order to do this exercise, you need to all be seated around a table. It doesn't have to be circular, but you have to be a continuous grouping of people so that you are able to pass your idea to the left.
Each participant is able to pass their idea to their left continuously around in a circle. So that where we begin is where we end, meaning the idea we actually write is the last idea needed to fill the entire page.
All right, so now that you're extreme, mainly confused, let me show you how it's done. So Brainwriting consists of folding your paper into equal parts and then having that paper. I've done the numbers just for you all but starting with one, the first participant, the first individual, everyone will do this at the same time.
Every individual will fold their paper and then write their favorite idea that they've had for the day in the top corner. Okay, next, after they finish writing their idea, the clock starts. They pass their idea to the participant to their left.
That participant must read their idea and then build upon it in 1 minute. So they will have to bust it up or create a new idea inspired by that original idea. The cycle will continue of passing the idea to the left after a minute.
As facilitator, you will be in charge of time. You will have to make people panic so that they stay on the clock. Time boxing brainstorming forces you to create a greater quantity of ideas in a smaller amount of time.
It also forces you to throw logic out of the window as much of the time. You don't have the ability to think through all the shortcomings of your idea before getting it out there. Now remember the original idea which each participant will write down in the top corner of their paper.
Their rectangles must be plused up. So here's an example. The original idea is an app that prioritizes an individual's task for work. Now we passed it to the left and after 1 minute this is the idea that was on.
There a push notification of what task and when. So now it's not just an app, it's a push notification of what you need to do right before you need to do it. And it to the next individual we can see in the third idea.
It's an auto adjust if I skip a task. So maybe I don't want to do that task right now. Just not in the mood for it, don't have the resources or the energy to do it. Moves on to the next one. So to set the stage, you will be seated at a table.
With the participants or you as the facilitator can remain standing and not a part of the group. Everyone is in a circle or in a continuous shape, one page per participant. Everyone will write down their idea in the top corner of their page and then pass it to their left.
So everyone should have, after round one, just a page with one idea ready for them to add their own, plusing up the original idea or creating a new concept with a little bit of flavor from that original idea.
Now, while it sounds like a complex process, in reality it's very simple. Write your idea down, pass it to the left, continue until the page is complete. Now, if you have more than eight participants, that means the idea won't go all the way around the entire group.
I like to have this done with five to six participants. Although it doesn't allow us to fill in the whole page, it does get a lot of
energy going, it does generate a lot of ideas. What you will notice is around the third or fourth round, the ideas will become
Powered by Notta.ai
 
 so abstract that many of them aren't so useful.
But because we have such quantity, although many aren't useful, a handful might be. And just having those one or two really crazy, really incredible ideas is what we're looking for. We're kind of forcing people to dig through and forcing them out of that comfort zone which they normally will stay in during Brainstorming.
I have tried to do this three rounds, totally burned out everyone. I would recommend, if you are going to brainwriting only do it two rounds maximum, meaning two all the way times through of eight, filling in the entire rectangle, or else you'll lose the attention and energy of your participants for the remainder of your workshop.
So, since this is time boxed, you know how long it's. Per sheet. I've noticed about ten minutes is enough time to go through. As the participants get more and more used to creating ideas quickly, that minute can shrink down all the way to 30 seconds.
After several times going through the ideas, maybe on the third or fourth time, they have to write down a new idea on a new sheet of paper. What I like to do is just start decreasing the time, because I notice everyone is able to get their ideas out a lot faster.
So, Brainwriting, although it seems complex, is incredibly simple. Fold your page, get eight equal rectangles, write your idea in the top right hand corner of the page is a simple way to do it, and then go from there.
You can do it on the left, you could do it on the bottom left, whichever flows the best. Pass that single idea to your left, and then the timer starts for a 1 minute round, repeating every minute as the page passes across the room.
It's super energizing, it's super intense, and you get some incredible results from a very small time window. And that, my friends, is Brainwriting."
Medici Method,Easy,"4-7 participants per group, can have multiple groups","10-25 mins, depending on depth of brainstorming","This famous family of old Florence, Italy were known for their wealth... and their sticky fingers. While we don’t condone stealing, we do love being inspired by the ideas of others. With the Medici Method, we have a recipe using the special sauce of the world’s best companies to create our own, sometimes similar, flavor. We don’t always need to reinvent the wheel to reinvent the art of our possible.",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732284/lectures/39185894,"
Medici. Mama mia. That accent was terrible to get your attention, because this next exercise is all about generating ideas. Now, we call it the Medici method. I like to think it's because the Medici family from Florence took inspiration from a lot of places.
We're going to take inspiration from a lot of different companies that exist in the world today or in the past. So here's the setup. It's pretty simple. You write companies, cool thing, and crazy idea.
And before I dive all the way in, five to seven participants is my rule of thumb per chart. You can have multiple charts across the room. I just like to keep my group small so that the conversations are more in depth.
The setup again, companies cool thing, crazy idea. What I like to do is get the entire room full of participants listening all at once. And I ask the group, can you tell me, what are some of the most innovative companies in the world?
And they might say apple. They might say Facebook or Google. I can guarantee you that. They'll always say Tesla. So we say, okay, Tesla. Now, tell me, what's the cool thing about that company? What makes them unique?
And they might say something like, they push the limits on technology. And they think, that's amazing. That's so innovative that they're always trying to figure out the next thing, just going farther and farther.
All right, what I like to do is go through maybe five, six different companies, and the cool thing, the value that makes them unique. Now, tech pushing the limits. You can ask them to be a little more specific.
Really? Why are they so innovative? What makes you think they're so innovative? Write that down. Capture it. Put it on a chart where everyone can see. Send the individuals back to their groups. Sit them down.
Say you have. Four minutes to come up with as many crazy ideas thinking about the problem as if you were this company with this cool thing about you. So if we were thinking about me, I always forget to clean my knife.
The peanut butter. I love peanut butter sandwiches. I can never get the peanut butter off the knife. Huge problem. So if I was Tesla and I was pushing technology to the limits, and I know we have some self driving technology, well, maybe we have some self cleaning technology.
Now I don't need to clean my knife ever again because by thinking like Tesla, I've been able to create a solution to my own problem. So focusing on the problem, thinking as if you were the company and adding in that cool thing will allow you to generate more and more ideas.
Now it is through a filter, so those ideas will be from their perspective, but it allows you to completely leave behind your natural train of thought. Lets you put on sort of like a little temporary mask.
And thinking through what they see, you may be able to solve your problem even better than you could on your own. This is a simple brainstorming technique to generate as many ideas as possible and encourage everyone, in fact, I would say probably demand that everyone or it forces everyone to think outside of their normal realm and generates a lot of unique ideas that you would have never seen just by straightforward brainstorming.
That's the Medici method. Again, I like to do it over the course, ten to 15 minutes from the description to the sharing of ideas. The more ideas you have, the longer you can share based on what comes out of it.
You can always prioritize the best ideas and then figure out how to make them more tangible. This is just a starting point for you to yes and or plus up your ideas. And improve anything. Any problem you're trying to tackle?
The Medici method. Perfecto."
Index Funned ,Easy,"Unlimited number of participants, no more than 2 cards/prompts per Index Funned.","8-15 minutes, depending on number of questions. Only need 4 to 5 votes per card","When to use it? Before: Discussing and prioritizing ideas. After: Problem finding or defining a topic

Remember: time up means time up!",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732284/lectures/39185888,"It. This one is a lot of fun. Index funned. All you're going to need, bunch of index cards and a writing utensil for everybody. Okay? You can pass these out in advance so that they're sitting at everybody's table when they get there.
You can pass a survey out before everybody gets to the event. It to pre write some ideas or thoughts or questions down on some kind of prompt on each one of these and then pass them out. Okay? This is going to anonymize how we build and support each other's ideas moving forward.
It is a ton of fun. I love this one. It never gets old. For some reason, I always also like to have a playlist going so I can hit play for music. Here's how it works. Make sure everybody gets one of these.
You ask a very specific question, how are we going to solve this? Right? You could use like the how might we how might we improve upon this? Or how might we do this? How might we do that, et cetera. Okay?
You're going to have everybody take the time to answer it the first go around. I'd give everybody at least a minute, which potentially a little bit awkward. I wouldn't give any more any less than 45 seconds.
I probably wouldn't give any more than 90 seconds to answer a question like that. Boom. Go. Everybody writes it down. Then you say to everybody, all right, when I say go, your objective is to pass your card to at least five, six, seven people.
I want you to pass it to as many people as possible. The bigger number or you just calling out the most you can possibly do, the better, because people are going to go a little crazy here. You have to give this caveat before you let them loose or else you'll never get them back.
You go when I say time's up. I need you to stop, turn, look at me and wait for the next piece of instruction, okay? And then have some kind of clever way of doing it. Some people do the clap. You clap once, and then if you're around know, clap once.
If you can hear me, clap twice. A couple other people clap twice, and then so on and so forth until you get out. The whole group. You could do the Johnny and make some very weird noises. You can car or act like whatever.
You get everybody's attention. Okay, cool. Everybody's got their idea. You say go, you hit play, you're playing music. They're passing it. They're going crazy. Here's the thing. I thought the very first time I did this for a group of very senior individuals, and I don't mean age, just mean senior, right?
Tenured. I don't know the right word for that. Whatever. Important people, a lot of important people, I thought they would be a little bit duddy around this. They'd be like, oh, pass it here and pass it there, and oh, this isn't going to be very cool.
They got into it. I mean, the first time I did it told me it can be for any range of people from any kind of background. They will love this one. Something about passing an index card as many times as you can around the room to as many people is just funny.
I don't know why. It's just funny. Okay, so you get everybody's attention. You now tell them, all right, I want you to read what you have on your card. So hopefully you understand by now that if it's been passed around randomly four or five times, the odds of anybody knowing the card that they originally had, where it is and who it's from, or vice versa, the person that has the card, where it came from, et cetera, are close to zero.
Unless somebody's sitting there and watching everywhere that it goes, which they can't, because they have to pass their own card. So nobody knows where anybody's card is. It's fully anonymized, right?
And now you're going to do the next piece. You're going to tell them to read it, and if they strongly agree with it, they're going to flip it over on the back, and they're going to write a five. If they it absolutely oppose it.
They're going to put a zero. If it's okay, they'll put a one. If it's good, they'll put a two. If it's better, they'll put a three, et cetera, until you get to five. You're going to rate it zero to five.
Okay? Then you start the music again, they do it again. Then you do it again. You do it again. You do it again. And you would

You'd think that people would get really sick of passing cards and going to the next round, but they're, like, ready for it.
They can't wait for you to hit play and do it again. Again. I have no idea why. I don't know why. It just works. Okay, you get to the end, you have the last person that just went so there's five people that just went five different numbers on the back.
You have them add up the score, right? So you have a total of 25, and you have a minimum of zero. If everybody thought your idea was terrible, they're going to put a zero. You add them up, and you go.
Raise your hand if you have above ten, right? You're going to get a bunch of people to raise their hand. Raise your hand if you have above 15. Raise your hand if you have above 20. And if you have a couple cards that have above a 20.
Odds are that it is a very good idea. Either one person rated it at zero and everybody else rated a five, or everybody rated it pretty high for the most part. So what you're going to want to do is keep that going until you get two, three, four of these cards.
You grab the cards, you read from them in front of everybody, and you say, we agree. For the most part, at least five. Nine out of ten dentists recommend this one. Right? At least five people thought that this was a meaningful card, right?
So you're going to read it out loud, maybe have everybody sit down and have a meaningful discussion around what was on that card. You could if you wanted to do this a little bit differently, you could do everything that I've explained so far, but instead of rating something on the back, you plus up the idea below it.
So somebody says, One scoop of ice cream is delicious. You would write, I prefer two scoops of ice cream. That's even better. Whatever. It's a bad example, but it allows you to put your own thoughts in here and doesn't allow me to kind of steamroll you with my own.
Okay. You get them to plus up the idea every single time until it goes around. You can do that as many times as you'd like. I recommend that you don't really go more than four people because people have really bad handwriting, and some people write really big.
No matter how big your index card is, I've passed some monsters out before, and people still fill up the space no matter what you say to them. It just happens that way. So three or four people, you get to the end, and you just pulse the audience.
Hey, what card? If you're holding your card, do you think that the idea that you started with to the idea that you're currently at it is better, genuinely, for everybody? Yes. Cool. Read it. Let's hear it.
Let's talk about it. So a couple of different ways to do this. I can imagine that you might think of something that we haven't even discussed here that allows you to make this your own, truly and have a lot of fun.
Again, this is not something that looks like you're having a lot of fun and jokes, but for some reason, people passing each other, throwing cards to each other, it's just a good time. And it cuts down on the amount of discussion.
Get to get a consensus. You can do this in about with a group of 25 people you can do this in about, I'd say, seven minutes from start to end to reading, and then, obviously, your discussion after the fact can go as long as you need it to go to get to the root of what you're trying to talk about.

The human brain loves predictability and patterns. To help short-circuit traditional ideas, this tool forces participants to make connections from seemingly unrelated concepts, serving as a framework for the freedom of ideation and getting the group outside of the box.",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732284/lectures/39185882,"Forced Connections, another tool to add to your brainstorming kit. Simple, straightforward, and at times uncomfortable, here's all you need. A list of random words, excited participants with sharpies and post -its, and a problem to be solved.
So make sure you have a concrete problem to be solved before you dive into brainstorming with Force Connections. Now, I'm going to give some examples to give you some more context. It is literally just that simple. Your brain needs a stimuli in order to power through and create more ideas.
That's what those words will do. So the example I'm going to give you today is, we are, as a company, Acne Bathtubs. You're a standard bathtub producer, and we have the goal, or the problem statement, of how might we make better bathtubs?
How might we improve our bathtubs? Now, that's a simple problem statement, but can be a difficult one to actually be innovative with. So we're going to force our brain to make some connections. So I'll dive in and give some examples of what that would look like.
Here's the setup. Participants are sitting around the table. There's a stack of papers with random words on them. It can easily be done online as well. You as the facilitator will flip over, just like in a game of cards.
Flip over the paper to reveal a word. The individuals will have one minute to come up with as many ideas that would solve our problem based on what they think of when they see that word. So we'll go with the first one.
Beach. So when I think of beach and how to improve bathtubs, I think of a walk -in bathtub. I think of a saltwater bathtub. I think of waves, so a wave pool in the bathtub. I think of relaxing sounds that might make my experience in this tub even better.
All right, let's go to the next one. Bananas. How can I banana a bathtub? How about a non -slip bathtub? No matter what you do, you can't slip, right? Easy enough. What about this one? Random. Airplane cockpit.
How can I airplane cockpit a bathtub? What I think about is glass. Could it be a glass bathtub so I have a beautiful view? Could it be outside? Could the bathtub fly? Or maybe it has controls that allow me to control the music, the amount of bubbles, and the temperature all in one.
So those, that's a simple example of what that exercise could be like. Remember, start with a concrete problem. We like to use the how -might. We structure the format, our problems, define it really well, then put that on the wall where everyone can see it.
Make it very visual. Have the stack of words pre -done and make them as random as possible. There are plenty of word generators online that can give you that list already made. And one by one, go through at least five to eight words of inspiration.
If as an alternative you find people are stuck on a word and aren't creating ideas, go ahead and move to the next word. You can put this out so people can do it on their own without you having to be there. Generate as many ideas as possible and, as always, have a single place to put everyone's ideas so that in one visual snapshot you can see all the variety of ideas.
And then use one of the prioritization tools, big word for a little guy, use one of the prioritization tools to figure out what ideas have the most opportunity or the most interest around them so that, moving forward, we can get to execution and action.
That is Force Connections. While it is similar to 100 photos, it's a different technique of the same tactic. Force your brain to have more ideas."

This one is a ton of fun because people like to make messes everywhere. So you ask them to come up with an idea and you say, throw it on the ground. So now you're going to get people to just start throwing post it notes everywhere. They're going crazy. There's post it notes everywhere. It's like all over the place. And they're sticking together, but they're everywhere. They're just everywhere, all over. Okay, cool thing here. Get a big group of people together. Thank you, Johnny. You get a really good group of people together. Call it 30. They all get in a massive space in a circle, right? And they're going to, what is the problem we're attempting to solve? And you want them to throw as much in the middle as possible. A group of 30 won't look like a lot. If you could see what I see right now. They're just everywhere. It's a huge mess. Okay? And you don't need a rake that was just for show and maybe over the top, but the mess is real. If you can get a group of seven people in a school circle together or in a corner of a room to just come up with an idea and throw it on the ground, it's basically, it's freeing. It's allowing them to go, who cares if people like or hate my idea? I'm just going to write it and throw it very passively. Right? We're not going to sit here and talk forever. The whole objective is to make a mess on the ground, an actual mess, but you're going to write it down on a post it note with a sharpie and throw it on the ground as soon as you get it. So boom, throw it. Boom, throw it. And your group is just. So what ends up happening is some people will come run out of ideas, but you'll start to, you'll just keep seeing this person's seeing all these things being thrown and they realize they're not part of this mess. And so it almost, in a weird way, forces people to jump in and try to get messy and try to come up with an idea so they can throw one. Because for some reason, everybody likes to make a mess anyway. So at the very end, that's part one, part two of it is the very end. You attempt to pick up a color that wasn't yours or handwriting that you know is not yours, and you pick it up and you say something about it. The reason that this is impactful, valuable, is that it is, in a way, anonymous. If you come up with enough ideas and you grab a random one and you go, I like this because, or I like, I wish, I recommend. Or, oh, we could add this to this.
Or yes, and, and you add an idea. Or, oh, this is very similar to this one. Or the idea I had earlier. It allows you to have and dive into another discussion when you clean up the mess. So I recommend instead of having everybody clean them up one at a time, you say, all right, based on this mess, I've got this section. You've got that section, you've got this section. So if I'm here throwing them, maybe I'm going to walk over there and clean up that mess. They'll come over here and clean up this mess, etcetera, etcetera. Or you move them all into the center with your hands, you kick them, and then you just hand out stacks to everybody so that they can have this discussion after the fact. As you'll know and recall from some of our other stuff, it's the discussion and the so what that comes after these, that is valuable. These things are just to kind of get the energy where you need it and to, you know, get people involved. The people that don't really have a voice gets them a chance to, in a weird way, feel like they're contributing and definitely having the ideas that they otherwise wouldn't have had in a group full of, you know, 15, 2030 people all saying, your idea stinks because of this, that and the other. It's just a framework. So this is leaf pile. You can leave
the rake at home or you can bring it. Either way, leaf pile."
100 Pics,Easy,"4-7 Participants per group, can have multiple groups",10-15 minutes,"When to use it? Before: Prioritizing a solution.
After: An initial round brainstorming
Materials
A stack of 100 random (VERY RANDOM) pictures with no relation, Post-its & Sharpies for each participant.
What is it?
Think differently through random inspiration. Like the big bang, this is all about intentionally creating chaos to spark
an explosion of ideas. Many very bad ideas in the search for a handful of GREAT ones!",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732284/lectures/39185840,"100 pictures. It could be 80 pictures. It could be 114 pictures. It doesn't matter. The idea is there's a ton of pictures. Okay. I like to potentially go on Google, find a ton of stuff that has nothing to do with the next thing and the next thing or why you're doing a workshop whatsoever. It could be a swimming pool or a bicycle or a dog or a cat. It could be beads hanging from a ceiling, fruit from all over the world. It can literally be anything that you want. The objective here is to get people to think a little bit differently through a different lens of their current idea creation, prototype, MVP, whatever. So what you're going to do is you don't need anything other than the pictures you see. Scatter them around a table. There's a lot of ways to do this. You can force give them to people. So, meaning they sit down at a desk and they are stuck with the one that they've got. Or you can spread it on a table and have them come up to the table and pick what speaks to them. The idea here is there's so many pictures, more pictures than people that are actually participating, that they'll be able to walk up, select one that speaks to them and kind of walk away. Now they have the postcard or picture or something in their hand, and now they're going to build upon the idea that they had before or use a different kind of scenario to move forward with their discussions, etcetera. So a really good way to do this is to have everybody zero in on the single best idea that they have moving forward, and then have them go to the table, grab the thing, and then build upon yes, and the idea and plus it up until they get to the next and the next and the next for the ultimate discussion that you're going to end up having. So I've also done this with postcards before. You can buy these online, maybe a little bit cheaper, and this will allow, or wherever you find postcards. And you can do it where you have objects for one stack and you have kind of Personas for another stack. So just random people. Totally random people or superheroes or whatever. It doesn't matter. Two different tables. They pick up two. They pick up one from this one and one from that one. Now they're going to use this new person and this object to bring them together and build upon the story of the idea that you had. I know that sounds crazy, but when you force people to do it, they're going to draw out things that you never thought possible. They're going to say, oh, because of this green background, I noticed that we are attempting to save a lot of Energy here. And we're going to save energy by accomplishing x, Y and z by lmNop. Right. People are going to pull out what they see, what they feel, and it's just kind of allowing them to take a step back, see the forest through the trees, so to speak, and remove themselves from how much they're stuck in their idea or thought, and move them to the side so that they can kind of, you know, create some depth to it. So you don't need 100 pictures. You might have 200. It really depends on how many people you have. I'd argue that you can do this entire thing with a group of 30 people in about five minutes, enough for them to come up with an idea, grab it, and ideate on that. Now, the discussion, obviously, is going to last a lot longer than that.
And if you do the one where I mentioned before, where you have the superheroes or the Personas, etcetera, and another pile over here for the objects, I double that. Maybe at least make it ten minutes or so so they can kind of really get settled into who their Persona is. And the other card that they pulled up, and this is 100 pictures."
Art Show,Easy,As many as desired.,10-15 minutes,"When to use it?
Before: Prioritization of ideas. After: A brainstorming session.
Number of Participants As many as desired.
Materials
Tape, paper & sharpie for each participant, and ideas conceived in the previous brainstorming exercise.
What is it?
Picasso? Meh. Finger painting, maybe. In this exercise, participants will get the chance to share and inspire others with their own idea. Silently, they will rotate around
the room observing, stealing, and combining ideas from others into new opportunities. See you at the Louvre!",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732284/lectures/39185841,"This is an example of how you can have somebody teach you a module two minutes ago and then provide it as if you know exactly what you're talking about. And part of being a facilitator is that confidence to be able to tell people what they need to do, have them go where they need to go, etcetera. So this was Johnny's module. He was coming up here and we decided to let me try it out. So I'm going to tell you all about what Johnny Drew. This is called art show, and the whole purpose of doing this is to very rapidly get your ideas out and be able to showcase and see where everybody else is in a room, to be able to plus it up and have discussions as you go. So really all you need is a piece of paper sharpie for everybody so that they can pass it around. If you want to have dots and whatnot, you can get into that later. You can make this one your own, but that's where you start. You do not have to be a Picasso. I don't know why I say Picasso, I guess. I don't know a lot of other artists. Maybe Salvador Dali. Yeah, let's go with that one. So this is what you're going to do. I'm going to get this super close. You're going to do a catchy name, you're going to do a sketch, and you'll have the value of the idea. That's all you need to do. You need to remember three things, really. If you're in a workshop, you need to tell them four things. Number one, catchy name. Number two, sketch. Number three, value of idea. Number four, have fun. And who cares how terrible you are at drawing? You can make this anonymous if you want. Or you could have them sign their name at the bottom if they've just got a work of art here. So here's some examples of what you're going to ask them to do. All right, we've got dolphin sneaks. There's a really awesome picture that Johnny drew of a dolphin wearing sneaks. And I'm going to read this. It says, keep non land mammals comfortable on land. It's a brilliant idea. Good job, Johnny. The next one, not a mint. So this is to avoid all, all close talkers. And it says, great taste, bad smell. Here's the thing. You're going to get people to put these on the wall around or on a table, depending on what your setting looks like. And when they're done, they're going to kind of go around like an art show and they're going to see what everybody else has and take notes.
So you might want to put like a one above the first one and a two and so on and so forth. So that when they go and paste it up there, or use painters tape and whatnot and paste it up there, you're able to go, okay, on number one, this is what I noticed. This is what I love. This is what I would do to make it different. This is how I could. Blah, blah, blah. Right, you've heard us before. I like, I wish, I recommend there's some other things that you can do to either plus up their idea or make your own. Right. They're going to go around the art show and list out to themselves what they think they can do to make it better. Now, you do a second round. This second round allows you to steal from other people's artistic beauty. And I don't just mean in the sense of drawing, I mean in the sense of names, in the sense of the so what? Behind that idea, solution set, etcetera. And that is you go around, you maybe make it a little bit faster, add some music to it, and now you get to see, okay, well, hey, there was four or five really, really good ideas that everybody saw, and now they're emulating those ideas or plusing them up, etcetera. When you get to the end. I don't know, I've never been to an art show, but I would imagine at the end you talk about how really cool the artist is. Maybe this is similar where you get to the end and you have a discussion about what
they thought, how you could make it better, etcetera, and kind of work together as a team to kind of have that camaraderie around the idea and potentially that buy in to move forward with that idea. So to wrap this up, Johnny told me this about two minutes before we started. I started rolling. I think I told you maybe seven times the amount that Johnny did before we started, just to see if you could confidently learn something new and execute it. So all the things that Johnny and I are going through right now, you should be able to make it your own, you should be able to make the title your own, change the way that you do it in a little small fragments. I would not leap too far off of what we've done right out of the gate if you're new to facilitation, because you might not know what worked or didn't work because of that change. So make the tweaks and changes on your own. That one is called art show."
Batter's Box,Medium,Unlimited. More of a tactic used for organizing the group,6-8 minutes,"When to use it?
Before: Beginning complex exercises After: Comnig from a break
Materials
Two designated spaces in the room.
What is it?
One could say this module is a ""home run"". Using a
central area for presentations and a second area
prepped for sharing, this exercise encourages effective communication and a space dedicated to the preparation
of thoughts. Who's on deck???",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732284/lectures/39185843,"I don't even play baseball. But batters box will be a really good one for you in your workshops, whether it's a meeting, etcetera, is to move people along very quickly and prepare the next person or people or group of people to come up with their thought, idea, discussion point, et cetera. It's simple. You have the single place that you're going to have everybody speak from. Call that where I'm standing right now. You designate an area off to the side, either over here or over here, where the next person is up and they know they're up. So it's one thing where we're all actively listening to the person going. It's another to put somebody in the batter's box who might need to be thinking about what they're going to say next. And it's okay that they're sitting there potentially not fully involved in this next person. In my opinion, some of you may not agree, and that's okay. Either way, the batter's box allows you to say, all right, you, you're up next. You're up on deck. You're on deck, you're coming next. And you can kind of, as a facilitator, you can kind of poke and produce people to always fill the box. Now, you can put 2345 people in it. It can be a line, it can be one person, etcetera. But the whole purpose is when the one person is done, the next person is up, and it just keeps the tempo going, it keeps the ideas flowing, it keeps everybody engaged in what's going on. Something to be done, maybe after a break or after you get back from lunch, this is not anything that takes any extra time. In fact, it saves time. So regardless of what kind of module or event that you have going on, putting a batters box in place, this can even be in the virtual setting, kind of a who's on deck or what kind of order do we have is really going to make things go a lot faster. And I think you're going to get a lot more out of your group if you do this."
Brain Vomit,Easy,4-12 participants (can be divided into smaller groups).,7-12 minutes,"When to use it?
Before: A more complex brainstorming tool. After: Identifying atopic for ideation.
Materials
Nothing. Well, Post-its & Sharpies, and the first penguin to push off the iceberg.
What is it?
Leaning into passive ideas, Brainvomit helps shake off the nervousness around creativity and get the ball
rolling toward filter-free ideation. Cut off the feedback loop and hit the high notes on quantity",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732284/lectures/39185843,"If you've ever been on a call with me, chances are I've said brain vomit to you more than once. Brain vomit and passive ideas is a really good way to get everybody to kind of shake it out. Who cares if you mess this up or mess that up or if you get on somebody's nerves, et cetera, et cetera. Passive ideas. Okay, what do you need? You don't need anything. Nothing at all, except for a group of people willing to kind of jump in and be the first penguin to be pushed off the iceberg, right? Typically, when we give ideas and when we receive feedback, we either, if we're receiving it, we get defensive. Potentially, if we're giving it, we want to qualify why our idea is so good. Our idea is so good because of this, that, and the other, and oh, my gosh, you could save so much money and time and all the frustration that would melt away. And it's amazing because of this. And oh, my God, we could do it this way and that way, and all we really need is for her to sign this and for him to do that, and we're done. And everyone's like, instead of just saying, here's the idea, and move on. The reason that meetings last as long as they do, the reasons why workshops feel like they potentially drag on forever and ever is because you don't stop that feedback circle. You don't stop the people that are upset about something. Oh, but my idea was better because, or that that idea wasn't as good as mine because, or sticking up for your idea or whatever. Or another example would be somebody comes up with a great idea and you go, oh, yeah, that's a really good idea because of this, this and this. And I really like that idea. You've now spent more time talking about why that idea was good than potentially coming up with more thoughts, ideas, solution sets, etcetera. And so passive ideas is a way for you to say to everybody out loud, hey, look, you can say your piece in about five to 7 seconds, but when you're done, you are not allowed to talk anymore. There's no more qualifying your idea anymore. There's no more anything except for the next one and the next one and the next one. What you're going to find is it's going to go quicker. People aren't going to get upset. They're going to be okay with kind of just moving forward. If it was a really bad idea, nobody's going to spend five minutes talking about why it was a bad idea. If it was a really good one. Hopefully the next people that come in and talk about it in this discussion are going to come up with ideas that revolve around that one. They're going to plus it up in some way, shape or form if it really is genuinely good. So you're going to speed things up, the quality is going to be better, etcetera. And I guess the best way that I can explain this is I think the statistic has come out of my brain somewhere that doesn't exist in real life, but I believe this is true. I think we waste about 60% of our time when we're in meetings and in workshops talking about why something was either really good or really bad, as opposed to just being okay with what's the 75% of the stuff that we just agree on, and then we'll talk about the stuff we disagree on, or we'll talk about the way forward with the specific ones we want to move forward with, et cetera. So again, you don't need anything. I'm sure you can get people to write stuff down. I'm sure you could use this in the beginning of a discussion at the end of the day to wrap things up. This is just kind of a way of running almost any type of event that you are doing, any module or workshop event type of thing that's just going to help it move along faster and get people to just let go and brain vomit. Just no rhyme or reason. You say it, you move on, it's over. Brain vomit."
Bucket Bonanza,Easy,5- 7 participants in agroup seated at a table.,8-10 minutes,"When to use it?
Before: Prioritizing solutions
After: Identifying hte problem or topic of focus
Materials
A bucket or multiple buckets, pieces of paper or Post-it's for thoughts, Sharpies &Post-its for each individual.
What is it?
A method for gathering anonymous ideas from the crowd. Using a specific question as a prompt, the tacilitator will ask the group to write down as many responses as possible and then ""dump"" them in the bucket. These hidden ideas can be read aloud or reviewed for future use. By using ideation with a bucket,
fewer participants will hide their thoughts.",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732284/lectures/39185865,"Bucket bonanza. You're going to need a bucket, bunch of sticky notes, sharpies or pieces of paper or whatever to put inside the bucket to hold ideas, thoughts, conclusions, etcetera. You can throw in the bucket. I prefer to have my bucket visible for everybody to see what's going into it just makes it look cool. You don't have to do that. You can get a, you know, three $3 bucket from Lowe's or Home Depot, and you can have several of them. I've done this before where I put seven or eight of these throughout the entire room. I label what they need to put before they have a thought going into it. We can get into that another time for this time. This is a way that you can get anonymous ideas from the crowd without having to put people on the spot and say, well, what were you thinking? Why were you thinking it? Etcetera. You can instead start by giving everybody sharpies and pens, you know, sharpies and sticky notes and going, all right, for this next exercise, I want you to come up with all the problems that we're having with this, or how might we improve that, or how might we, etcetera, fill in the gaps of whatever kind of question you want to get at. I'd be as specific as possible with your question because this is anonymous. So you want to pull, you want to pull some of these nuggets out of from the crowd. So I like to have a top to the bucket. The reason for that is once people put it in, if there's anything that is, you know, people want to get to afterwards, put the top on the bucket, make sure that it stays safe. It's a safe space. Right. We're all in this together. We're all, you know, working towards the same common goal here type of thing. Don't need to have a top for the bucket at all, but got a bucket. Now imagine you've got a ton of ideas. You can put one of these behind a board and basically start a line and have everybody, one by one, throwing these in. They're not actually saying out loud what these ideas are. Hopefully they get in the bucket and if they don't, you're there to kind of grab it. You're the anonymizer of this machine. Right. Anyways, they throw in all their ideas, they come through. Now, when it's done, that's the start. It's not the end of this exercise. You actually grab the bucket and you're going to reach in and go one by one and you're either going to read them out loud, which I like to do. It's somewhat awkward but potentially detrimental if somebody says anything that is just terrible in the positive or the negative, that just gets Everybody riled up right for the wrong reason. So what you can do is you do this right before a break. You send everybody on a big enough break that you can pull, pull all of these from it. You can sit there with a co facilitator or yourself and put them into bins or buckets or categories, whatever you want to call them, right? So that when everybody gets back, you can say, hey, the common theme of what I asked you was this, and I'd like to zero in on this comment and that comment and this problem or this solution. And then you're going to have a meaningful discussion about what wound up in the bucket. Keep the stuff that's in this. This will help you for your after action report.
This will help you for prompting discussion later on. It will prompt you for looking back on the workshop and going, did we accomplish what we set out to do? Or maybe you do the exact same thing at the end and go, are any of these things going to be better from the solutions that we've come up with today and kind of get that feedback from everybody. I have used this one for a very pointed feedback for the boss. What do you not like about the
boss? I get their permission beforehand. We've talked about this before with Johnny. Get their permission. If they say yes, you have one of these buckets and people throw it in on their way out. It's totally anonymous. Instead of letting the handwriting pass on to the boss, you rewrite or retype all of them so that you can just give a very candid, this is what your people think of you response to the boss. And if they're open to that kind of culture and that kind of, you know, self improvement type of thing, it is beneficial. You can use this for a million different exercises. I love it. This is called bucket bonanza. It will not take very long, depending on how many people you have just to get everybody to think of the ideas or thoughts, solutions, problems and throw them in the bucket. I like to save more time for that discussion, that meaningful discussion than the bucket itself, but this is a way to anonymize their thoughts."
Forced Connections,Medium,"3-10 participants per group, as many groups as needed.",7-18 minutes,"When to use it?
Before: Prioritizing or selecting a topic of focus. After: Identifying aproblem set.
Materials
Post-its & Sharpies for each participant prepped ""inspiration cards.""
What is it?
The human brain loves predictability and patterns. To
help short-circuit traditional ideas, this tool forces participants to make connections trom seemingly unrelated concepts, serving as a framework for the freedom of ideation and getting the group outside of the boX.",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732284/lectures/39185882,"Forced connections another tool to add to your brainstorming kit. Simple, straightforward, and at times uncomfortable. Here's all you need. A list of random words, excited participants with sharpies and post its, and a problem to be solved. So make sure you have a concrete problem to be solved before you dive into brainstorming with force connections. Now I'm going to give some examples to give you some more context. It is literally just that simple. Your brain needs a stimuli in order to power through and create more ideas. That's what those words will do. So the example I'm going to give you today is we are, as a company, acme bathtubs, your standard bathtub producer. And we have the goal or the problem statement of how might we make better bathtubs? How might we improve our bathtubs? Now that's a simple problem statement, but can be a difficult one to actually be innovative with. So we're going to force our brain to make some connections. So I'll dive in and give some examples of what that would look like. Here's the setup. Participants are sitting around the table. There's a stack of papers with random words on them. Can easily be done online as well. You, as the facilitator will flip over, just like in a game of cards, flip over the paper to reveal a word. The individuals will have 1 minute to come up with as many ideas that would solve our problem based on what they think of when they see that word. So we'll go with the first one. Beach. So when I think of beach and how to improve bathtubs, I think of a walk in bathtub. I think of a saltwater bathtub. I think of waves. So a wave pool in the bathtub. I think of relaxing sounds that might make my experience in this tub even better. All right, let's go to the next one. Bananas. How can I banana a bathtub? How about a non slip bathtub? No matter what you do, you can't slip, right? Easy enough. What about this one? Random airplane cockpit. How can I. Airplane cockpit. A bathtub. What I think about is glass.
Could it be a glass bathtub? So I have a beautiful view. Could it be outside? Could the bathtub fly? Or maybe it has controls that allow me to control the music, the amount of bubbles, and the temperature all in one. So those, that's a simple example of what that exercise could be like. Remember, start with a concrete problem. We like to use the how might we structure the format our problems? Define it really well. Then put that on the wall where everyone can see it. Make it very visual. Have the stack of words pre done and make them as random as possible. There are plenty of word generators online that can give you that list already made and one by one go through at least five to eight words of inspiration. If as an alternative, you find people are stuck on a word and aren't creating ideas, go ahead and move to the next word. You can put this out so people can do it on their own without you having to be there. Generate as many ideas as possible and as always, have a single place to put everyone's ideas so that in one visual snapshot you can see all the variety of ideas and then use one of the prioritization tools. Big word for a little guy. Use one of the prioritization tools to figure out what ideas have the most opportunity or the most interest around them so that moving forward we can get to execution and action. That is forced connections. While it is similar to 100 photos, it's a different technique of the same tactic. Force your brain to have more ideas."
Crazy Eights,Medium,"Individually completed, 3-10 participants in group sharing.",10-12 minutes,"When to use it?
Before: Discussing and prioritizing ideas.
After: Problem finding or defining a topic of focus.
Materials
Sheet of blank paper (folded into 8 equal-sized squares) per participant.
What is it?
Timeboxed, intense ideation. It can feel overwhelming, but this pressure cooker of a brainstorming exercise forces participants to create concepts ""filter-free"" ... because there is no time to question the quality of a
concept.",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732284/lectures/39185867,"Crazy eights. Similar to an alternative exercise, brain writing is more an individual exercise, an individual deep dive into ideating. What you're going to want to do is first make sure you're at the point in the process of needing to create lots of ideas. You're going to need to give each participant a simple sheet of a one paper, which you will show them how to fold. You'll fold it into eight equal rectangles, folding it tall ways twice, and then folding it one more time to make eight equal rectangles. Now, what your participants are going to want to do is start by creating one initial idea. That initial idea can go in the top corner of the page where I have one written. Okay, and now what you're going to do is put them on the clock. They will then have 45 seconds to improve upon that original idea or completely change it. Whoo. That was tough, right? 45 seconds to create a whole new idea. Well, it turns out you're going to have to repeat that over and over again until we finish and fill out this entire page. Now, if your participants aren't able to create an idea that round, it's totally okay. Tell them to catch their breath, leave that one blank, and move on to the next one. We're not going to leave anybody behind. It isn't time crunched, intense exercise, which many people can find overwhelming. What it does is by putting that number, the amount of time, the hyped energy in the room, it forces you to get out of your own way and put really what your gut is feeling about that idea. No more logic or questioning the shortcomings, but directly diving into, let's throw out as many solutions as possible. So in just a matter of eight minutes, essentially a little bit less. If you're totaling up 45 seconds, in a little bit less than eight minutes, you're able to create eight completely unique ideas by building a pawn or throwing out and completely putting in a random concept on the page. It feels a little bit forced at first, but then it gets increasingly more fun as you get used to the process. Again, this is similar to brain writing, but as opposed to sharing the paper throughout the room where you're given a random idea and asked to add onto it, these are your own ideas, your own concepts that you're trying to make unique to yourself. So it forces you again to think outside of the box in a very short amount of time. And if you have a group of people, say, five to seven or more in the room, you can ask each individual to circle their favorite idea of the bunch, draw it out a little clearer, and then present it to the rest of the group for insights, for note taking, for narrowing down on our next steps on our solution. And that is crazy. Eights in less than eight minutes."
Creative Matrix,Medium,"Up to 5 participants per group, can have multiple groups",20-25 Minutes,A systematic ideation process that utilizes a matrix format to generate and combine ideas from different categories and user groups. This exercise consists of timed brainstorming sessions and rapid idea sharing to ensure a broad range of concepts are explored.,https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732284/lectures/39185869,"Keanu. Whoa. The matrix of creativity. Thanks, Keanu, for the introduction. In this simple exercise, which you can really, you put everything into a box so there's no confusion. You walk your participants through forced brainstorming activity. That means you're going to have to draw two points together to create ideas. Now, as you can see to my side, I have an example already created. This is based on a concrete problem. So before you start this exercise, you are going to want to have a problem well defined and well listed out. Maybe that's with a how might we statement. So our problem that we're trying to solve right now is how might we make package holiday vacations more attractive to our customers? For this exercise, which takes about 20 to 25 minutes, depending on how crazy you go, you can have up to five participants per group anymore, and this board gets way too crowded. You'll need a much larger board and many more flip charts. I think, best practice, you could probably spread this out three times the amount of what I have right here so that each square has enough space for five to six ideas. Participants will need a fat stack of post its sharpies. Bring back up sharpies, as always, and some creativity juices already flowing. So, with our concrete problem of how to make packaged vacations more attractive to our customers, the first thing we're going to do is write out all of our customers. So get the group to do it on their own. Define a handful of customers for this creativity matrix. Don't make it more than, I'd say, five or six wide just because you will get lost. You can make it wider if you're feeling more ambitious, but it just really kind of zaps all the energy once you hit that five list wall. So we've got an example here of the different users, families, couples, young singles, and retirees. These are all people that could purchase a packaged vacation. Simple enough. The next step that we're going to do is define the categories. The categories go up and down, the users go left to right. Okay, so the categories, again, this is an opportunity to brainstorm. In this scenario, what we want to do is break down the common blocks that make up whatever we're trying to solve. Whatever that package, in this case, is, the categories you can brainstorm as a group. I find that to be best practices. If you're an experienced facilitator, simply listening to the room and the situation, you can summarize them on your own and plop them up there so that the participants themselves don't have to get stressed out about finding each category. Now, in order to complete the exercise, what you're going to do is give everyone five minutes to silently try and fill up this entire board with as many ideas as possible. That is, sitting down, writing ideas, post its, post its, post its, flying through them, trying to connect families with partnerships. What idea could we offer in the vacation setting? Vacation. I said it funny, the vacation setting for families. And we mix in partnerships or discounts, right? Come up with as many ideas. Once you run dry on that individual square, move to the next one.
Continue through until you've completed all the different sections. Now, at the end of five minutes, you may have not gotten through everything. That is okay. There should be enough ideas on the board to start inspiring you more in the next five minutes. What we're going to do is start sharing ideas out loud and building on the ideas of others. That's a yes. And trying to add to the ideas that you already have on the board. Combine two, subtract one, put it in a new place, have an idea for family that you then can apply to young singles,
get creative in mixing and matching, and continue to fill the board till it's almost overwhelming. Now, after these ten to twelve minutes of brainstorming, everyone probably is a little tired. They'll be on their feet, but they'll be tired. But we'll be able to then narrow it down using some of the conversion exercises we have. In other sections, you can simply look at the board, discuss. You should already know the majority of the ideas up there from your conversations as participants, and then pick the handful of ideas that seem the most interesting and move them on to the next round. So, creativity matrix. The basics are you're going to pick users, you're going to pick categories, and you're going to intentionally, within the squares, try and force ideas with both inclusion and young singles or families and experiences to try and force your brain into generating ideas. Like I've said many times before, and I'll continue to say it because it's so true, brains need framework. Humans need framework. Creativity needs framework. In this exercise, you literally have a framework, a box, to help instigate your innovative ideas, and you can do it all in under 20 or 25 minutes."

Maybe in this brainstorming activity, you are going to have a very fun time. Now all you need is a group of energetic participants and a handful of very random objects. Literally random, whatever you can get your hands on. You're going to want to have a problem well defined, so that now in this stage, you're looking to create opportunities and ideas similar to force connections. This is forcing you to look at a physical object and then create a solution based on that object. So to simulate the scenario, I'm going to do my best to walk through how might we make better chocolate chip cookies, a personal passion of mine. I'm going to pick up a random object, I'm going to throw out an idea, and I'm going to walk you through what that experience looks like. Before I do that, let's talk materials. You need your random objects post its for each participant, sharpies and about ten minutes of time, because you might need to recover from laughter. So each round will have one object in one to two minutes of time for individuals to create as many concepts or solutions as possible. I'm going to do an abbreviated version, picking up an object, shouting out an idea. I recommend individually, silently writing down your ideas after each round. After each object, let everyone stand up and share their ideas. Talk about the similarities, talk about how you can combine them together. Yes. And the ideas and potentially keep one and execute upon it. So here we go. I'm going to reach down here, I'm going to grab something, and then I'm going to try and make an idea about how we could make chocolate chip cookies better based on that object. Object one, this cord thingy. So I think electricity. We could put pop rocks in the chocolate chip cookies for a more interactive flavor. I see that it's standard. We could make sure that each chocolate chip cookie has the exact same amount of chocolate chips so that we're never eating one bite without a good ratio of chocolate chip to the sugary sweetness and butteriness of the cookie. So there's one cheesy crackers. I'm thinking add some sea salt to the top of the chocolate chip cookies because I see sea salt thinking crunchiness. Is there a way we can make them wafer thick so that there's an added crunchiness? Cheese. I don't really have anything for cheese. I'm not gonna lie. I don't really want cheese. But I do think we could make a chocolate chip cookie sandwich. And that's an option there. So inspiration. Last one. This is pretty on the nose. Baking gloves. Baking gloves. Rubber. Rubber.
Is there a benefit to cooking chocolate chip cookies on a silicon pan? Could we make patterns in the chocolate chip cookies so that they are like designer grade chocolate chip cookies? Thinking, what if we only serve our chocolate chip cookies piping hot? Is there a way to make sure chocolate chip cookies are gooey forever? Those are the ideas I've come up with based on three random objects. I didn't prepare this, so I didn't cheat. John can confirm that's how object based brainstorming works, and I think it's objectively good."

Now that I've gotten your attention with a very odd beginning story to this exercise, I'm going to introduce you to the parking lot. This is your fallback tool for any time you're finding discussions are going awry. You're not talking about what we're actually meant here to be talking about. You're telling stories about Lil June's birthday party. You're telling ideas about different Nike shoes that you could be purchasing. You're not heading in the direction of solving anything. It's more just talking to talk or it's a valid point, but not one that's going to contribute to the continuity, the focus, the drive of the workshop. What I like to do is have a parking lot set up next to every group that I'm going to be running through the workshop. So if I have four groups and four corners, I'll put a parking lot next to each of the corners so that any time during the discussion that they're having during an exercise, if they start going off topic noticeably, I'll encourage them to call each other out and use the parking lot. I'll establish this before even going into the exercises that hey, everyone, if you notice that the discussion starts going off the rails and you're really focusing on something that's not enhancing the conversation, or you have two individuals that are really focused on a discussion about a particular thing, but it's not something they can solve in the meeting and it's not helping us progress, you're going to allow them to write down what they're talking about and just plop it on the parking lot. Simple enough. It cuts the conversation off. That's distracting and gets us back to moving forward. Now, it can seem a bit rude, but if you set it up at the beginning and say, hey guys, we're trying to stay on time, we're trying to stay focused on topic. I'll be walking around the room, kind of deciding if we're actually diving into the right direction or slowing down. If we are slowing ourselves down, we'll just write down that idea or that question for further discussion later. But at this time, we're not going to focus on it. So that's parking lot. It's a tool to lean on so that when things go awry, you can always get everyone back focused. It keeps it from being as rude to cut people off in conversations. So park it, junior."

If you've brainstormed ideas, you have them possibly prioritized. You have five or so, maybe an idea per participant. I like to have an idea for every four participants because here is what they are going to have to do. Group the participants and allow them to select the idea they want to build or simply assign it. Remember, you need to start off with those prioritized ideas. Next, you're going to have to prep a handful of completely white boxes, and you're going to task them with the following. Now imagine if your idea was sold in a department store. We're going to design the packaging that it comes in. It's a simple box that you have to fill out each side in order to actually describe it. So a customer can pick it up, look at it, and learn everything they need to know about it before deciding whether or not they need it. I have made, and because I'm terrible at wrapping, I have made a box here myself. So we're going to start off with the first and most easy, well, the easiest side to do, which is naming of the box and coming up with a slogan. So you will name your idea and come up with a slogan about it. Next, you're going to write the key benefits of that idea. Why is this idea valuable on the other side? Boop. Of course we're going to say how to use it. Are there requirements for using it? Are there requirements on our end for making it? And of course, on the back we've got this definition of the customer type. This can be actually a Persona that you fill out. But who is this product for? Simple, straightforward. If you want to get even farther into conversation, you can ask them to describe what they would fill the box with. That can be the context of the idea itself, the detailed description of the idea. That can be what's inside of it. Easy to do. If there are other factors, like an expiration date, you can put that on top of when the idea or project should be completed. It's a simple, straightforward exercise, which I love, that allows all individuals to get excited, get creative, and really well define their idea. After each group is finished, I like to give them 20 to 30 minutes to really try and decorate this thing as incredible as possible. I'll have colored markers, stickers, everything you can imagine for an intense arts and crafts adventure to build these boxes. Now, the best boxes you can probably find are going to be at your common FedEx store. Walmart has some really cheap options for less than a dollar not to give them a sponsorship, but we haven't given out a sponsorship in a while. A little shout out. So after each group finishes their boxes, maybe 20 to 25 minutes in. I like to give each group two minutes max two and a half minutes to share their ideas. We'll set up like a stage and they'll have a pitch where they describe the box, they tell each side of it, and they walk through what it actually is and how they're going to get it done. After each group goes well, hopefully they'll have fans of their idea.
I allow for an applause session at the end for each idea for voting. Or you can actually do the bucket approach, which is mentioned in another video where you vote by simply dropping your post it into a bucket underneath the idea they like the most. While everyone is sharing. An interesting extra that you can do for your participants is ask them all to take notes on the ideas, track what they liked about each, and how they could add it onto their own concepts. This is kind of a middle ground of ideas in the process of brainstorming. So you have a defined idea, a defined product, but it allows you to continue enhancing it by
stealing from the concepts of others in the room. And since we're all in one organization, building a better overall project, process or product, or maybe even even a person, and that is the product box can be called the cereal game. It is entirely too fun to end a workshop, so I highly recommend it."

In this simple exercise, you're going to try and generate an incredible quantity of ideas, focusing in on the existing topic or the existing way things are done and trying to expand them into completely new things by following the step by step guide I have here to the right. So scamper is also known by Osborne's method or Kipling's method. It is just an acronym that spells out substitute, combine, adapt, modify, put to another use, eliminate, or reverse. So, scamper, when you put it all together, this technique is often used by product teams in order to expand upon the ideas that they currently have. Maybe they're too focused in and they need an intentional stimuli. Again, this is just by putting a filter on you, a focus point. It helps you. Humans need framework in order to be creative. This is an incredible framework to keep you on some rails, building on ideas. Straightforward. Now, you're shifting every few minutes in order to do this exercise. I think it's best in even smaller groups than I normally suggest. So in groups of three to five, each individual group can have their own scamper board. Everyone needs post its and pins. We also encourage drawing a lot more in this exercise as it helps enhance your creativity. Your creativity. I lost my voice for a second. Here's how you do it. I'm going to give you an example of a physical product, and then we're going to talk a little bit about how you could apply it to onboarding or hr and expand from there so that, you know, this isn't just about physical things. It could be digital, it also could be experiential. So it falls into an excellent exercise for all different scenarios. So we're going to start looking at our scamper board that we have today. I have written a lollipop. So a lollipop is what we're going to try and ideate on. Now, I've only put one idea per section. I like to divide this up into two minute windows that you are time boxing on purpose. So for substitute, we have two minutes to come up with a way to make a lollipop and substitute some item on it for something else. So in this example, a lollipop. Well, let's take away the stick and let's make it a string. Now we have a bracelet for a lollipop. Done. We can move on to the next one. Again, try and create as many ideas as you can in that two minute window. You can encourage your participants just to pick their one or two best ideas so that you don't overwhelm the flip chart. That's simple enough. I also like to keep a single color for each section, or at least have three colors here and three colors here so that visually, again, it's not overwhelming. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to go through some of the examples really quickly so that you can get some context, and then we're going to come back and talk about it.
So, a lollipop. We know how you can substitute for it. How can you combine it? Well, maybe we can make our lollipops medicinal. So now I have a sore throat. I can lick the lollipop. It's delicious. It also helps me lollipop. How do we adapt it? Well, maybe instead of a temporary stick, which is my straw that I use every day, I can have a variety of lollipop options that I just plug the stick in and I'm good to go. How do we modify it? Maybe we modify who the user of the lollipop is. So we think of adults. We can season the lollipop for adults, so maybe it has a more beautiful, robust flavor to it. Now, lollipop, how do we put it to another use? Well, maybe it's one that just connects to your finger, much like a ring pop, but on the end of your finger, so that you can lick as you go or you can point. Maybe we can put it to

another use by making it spicier so that we can test the different spices that we're gonna try at the indian restaurant tonight, because we like to have an idea of how spicy things are before we actually dive in. Eliminate. Maybe we eliminate the stick altogether and we just make mini little ones similar to a tic tac. Maybe we partner with tic tac so that they get our flavors. They make our little, tiny, round, delicious non lollipops. Or maybe we reverse it. So instead of a lollipop altogether, before we make the pop, the lollipop solid concrete, we know that there's a liquid flavoring. What if we put that into a drink and we called it lollipop like soda pop, huh? So a variety of ideas that are very simple, very visual by thinking through the filters that we're given. So the tough part for individuals in this exercise is actually a lot of times they get caught up on an individual word and an individual meaning. Because I gave you these examples, you're probably going to lean towards similar ideas yourself. So you have to be very careful with the examples you give. If an individual gets stuck on the difference between combine and eliminate, let them know it's completely okay if you have a similar idea for one or the other. Our goal is to have as many ideas as possible. So if you can find a way to adjust it slightly so that it is more unique. Meaning, it's great that we had bracelet here. It would be tough if you had earrings here, because then we're just really getting stuck on a single theme and we're not generating the same quantity ideas we're capable of. So see if you can encourage them to shift their focus and find a different meaning of the word so that they can have more ideas. Again, this is all about idea generation, a forced change of perspective, similar to some of the other exercises we've done in the past. I like to have my participants go through the entire board again with that time box. Two minutes. At the end of time, we're still under 15 minutes. Everyone can share their ideas. Pick the top two or three that they think are amazing, get them together, let the group vote on some of those ideas.
And again, we can go back through if we have some incredible ideas and see how can we combine one or two of these ideas to make it even better. Is there something we can take away from one of these ideas to make it simpler and easier to use? It's an incredible, incredible tool that you can continuously innovate upon, no matter how deep you are in the design of the experience of the product of the process. This is called scamper. Again, it could be called by other names, such as the Osborne map or Kipling's method. I'm keeping it simple because there's a lot of resources to support this version of it online. We love it for the ideation phase, whether that is a digital or physical product, or. Here's an example for HR onboarding. So when we look at how are we going to do the scan for HR onboarding, put the topic in the middle and we think of how could we put it to another use? Onboarding. What if onboarding was actually on the job so that the experience of becoming part of the company was training as well, or it was feet on the ground knowledge that they could get. Maybe we can eliminate it altogether. Maybe there's no onboarding and everything is show up and just dive straight in. What if we reverse it? What if we treated their first day like it was their last day and that was our onboarding? What would that experience be like? And walk through those conversations so even in a snapshot, in a few seconds, we're able to see the value of this scamper exercise, whether it's physical, digital, or experiential. I look

forward to hearing how you use it, totally open to any questions. Send them our way so that we can help guide you through this experience on your own. Three to four participants per board. I would say 20 to 25 minutes to get the whole exercise completed. If you are broken into groups, have them all stand up and share their highlights, the top three or four ideas that they've come and that they've created from their exercise, so that all the groups can have all the ideas on the table. Look forward to learning more with."

Now, you may have seen them online. I'm going to walk you through this exercise, but first, let's talk materials. Flip chart for gathering ideas. Post its for writing ideas, sharpies for drawing ideas, and probably some dots for picking the best of the ideas. You can do this with as many participants as you want, but you're going to break up into teams of two or three. Each team will always have to create a team name, which can be their idea name, and they're going to be isolated in their separate little pockets for the majority of the exercise. Okay, so like I said, this is a brainstorming technique for when you're stuck and you just feel like there's no way out. This forces you to create the worst idea ever so that you can at least get some ideas out and then start building from there. The worst place you can be is completely trapped and without motion. Motion. Continued motion in the science world means that it's easier to keep you moving. That's what this exercise does. It can be used almost as a precursor to a big, huge brainstorming session. It can be an opportunity to break the pattern or the frustration that you have in the group, or it can just be something playful to do whenever there's just a lull in energy amongst the room. So I'm going to give you the walkthrough of how to use this whenever you're just trying to use it for a brainstorming tool. So, worst idea ever. What you're going to do, and what I like to do is have a few examples of chindangu on hands. I have one drawn up on the top left. I like to show actual videos or photos. If you want to find some funny, hilarious innovations, inventions that aren't really so practical, you can go to unnecessary inventions on Instagram or the website. Unnecessary inventions. Super playful, great examples to get people kind of inspired and in the mood to come up with some really bad ideas. So chindongu is an object or an idea that's seemingly completely useless, doesn't exist today, and it is a tool for everyday life. You can give them that context before you show them the examples. Now, for us and for our situation, we actually need to solve a problem. So we can't just make a stick of butter that you carry around everywhere you go because you really like toast or avocado to go, guacamole to go for those hipsters out there the same way, in this case, we actually have a real problem that we need to solve. We're just stuck. We can't find a way out and think of even any idea. So we're going to purposely try and think of what's the worst idea possible for this situation? How could we make this situation ten times worse? Now, that will be the prompt that you ask. All the different teams, set them up on their own, hit them with the prompt, and allow them to have five to seven minutes to individually brainstorm, probably for three to four minutes, and then three to four minutes to discuss the different ideas that they've come up with. Now, have them draw every idea and write a small description of the idea underneath. Drawing it, it just makes it more playful, more engaging, so that when we are sharing people from far away, people that aren't there actually listening to it, that just walk by the flip chart later on, can kind of consume the idea easily. Again, we're going to give them the prompt. How could we make this problem worse? What's the worst idea we could have to solve this problem? We'll give them three to four minutes to brainstorm, three to four minutes to discuss and choose one to two of their favorite awful, horrible ideas. We'll gather up all the groups, and we'll share amongst everyone the highlights of what we've created.

The goal of this is to make everyone comfortable with having ideas. Get people to start at least having their first idea, even if it is intentionally bad, and the opportunity to actually recognize the flaws in the system. If we can ideate ways to make it worse, we can reverse engineer that into an idea to make it much, much better. Now, it is a starting point. It is not your final destination. Do not pitch this exercise as the whole enchilada. This is a break in the pattern. This is a starting point for you to build into better ideas. Get out of the habit, get out of the spot that you're stuck in, and get the group with their brainstorming, with their ideas flowing once again. I call it chindangu because I love to give those examples. It's playful, it's fun. You can call it worst idea ever. Regardless, it'll help your group get moving, get in motion, so that you're able to create better solutions."

You don't want to be too obscure with the individuals to where no one in the room knows them. The goal is that they have an understanding perspective on this individual and how they think, and then they try and mimic their train of thought. This exercise forces us to take on a role. And that role, a lot of times, can encourage new, fresh ideas by looking at the problem from a different perspective. I like to give everybody three or four minutes. If we just have a handful of individuals, each single individual, we can do a little brainstorming around on. So if you have five individuals, just do a minute and a half per individual. Encourage everyone to create as many ideas as possible so that whenever we're done with this one, take it off, put up the next individual and get the brainstorming again. I want to reiterate, although it is very simple to say I'm thinking like Walt Disney, therefore I'm going to have these ideas. It's incredibly powerful. Do not underestimate the power of imagination and pretend acting. Role playing as if you were someone else will give you a new perspective will help you uncover more interesting, more unique ideas. So here's the exercise. In summary, get the group together, no more than five to seven. Make sure each individual has sharpies and post its. Generate a list of inspirational individuals which everyone in the room has context with or understands who they are. You can also explain. Give some background on each of them. Prompt the question for small, short time boxed rounds time box rounds of brainstorming.
Share those ideas, prioritize using one of the methods we have in other tools, the options, and then go on to actually making it happen. Simple exercise can be completed in less than 20 minutes. The smaller the group, the speedier it will go. The longer the list of inspirational individuals, the more time you have to brainstorm. Do not try and make them brainstorm for more than eight minutes. People will be burnt out. People will be tired. You'll notice the quantity and quality of the ideas will fall. I like to keep it around three individuals for a total of six minutes. After that, we can take a break, stretch a little, and come back and do more if we're really, really hungry for ideas. Otherwise, those six minutes should generate some incredible opportunities. And that was if I were."
