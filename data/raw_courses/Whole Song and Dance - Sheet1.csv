Mountain,Easy,"5-12 participants per group; can be multiple groups with their own“Mountains”
","Flip a chart or whiteboard with a dividing line
(Status Quo & Utopia), Post-its & sharpies for
each participant.",15-30 minutes,"Cut the red tape. Let’s get aligned on where we are and
where we need to go and start thinking of how to get
there. A tool that can be used with any group on any
topic, it is a simple process for gracefully guiding
conversations toward focus and progress.",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732421/lectures/39188384,"Before: Diving into any other tools. After: Kicking off a workshop with an
icebreaker or introduction","About to start a workshop, need to gain a ton of credibility. Have about, we'll say, 35 to 40 people. I've done it with a lot more. It adds more time. Obviously, you can do this one in about 20 minutes. More than that. If you dive a little bit deeper, a little bit less than that, if you're kind of getting people going. The purpose of this one is to get where you are now, where you want to go, and kind of all the actionable, tangible things that you can do from where you are to where you need to go. Remove the red tape, talk to the right people, get the smart metrics, etc, etcetera, with a group. So in order to show you, I'm going to bring out my little whiteboard. Now, imagine this is on the side of a really big wall. Wall. I'm doing this so that you can see it and you can kind of make this your own. It does not have to be a mountain. You can do a lot of different shapes. I've done a u before. I've done an m. I mean, I've done a whole bunch of weird stuff. A couple different parallel lines. So this is what you do. Grab a roll of painter's tape. Boom. You tell everybody this line right here represents the status quo. This line is the status quo. Everything below this is where we're not meeting the mark, where we are running out of resources, time, energy, effort, where we suck, where we are not achieving what we want to achieve on a day to day basis, on a month to month basis, on a year to year basis, whatever that is, right? Status quo. You're going to have everybody go, all right, I want everybody big circle, right? I want you to think about what that means to you and write down at a minimum, one each of the status quo of where you are, of where your team is, of where the organization is as a whole. It doesn't matter. I try not to be prescriptive here. I let them think about the micro or the macro kind of as a whole. What is the status quo of the now for you, your organization, et cetera. They're going to write it all around. I'm going to tell them. You're going to put that here. The objective is imagine a whole bunch of people coming up, right? These are, these are just three, but imagine 40, 50, 6100. I've done this before with almost 200 things below this line of the status quo. Now, when you get them to come and share, what they're going to do is they're going to come up, they're going to put it on the board. They're going to turn around to everybody else and very loudly and very clearly say what it is.
They're not going to talk for more than 5 seconds. 5 seconds is because you don't want to get into a why you thought of this idea or it's just the idea super quick. Status quo is we stink at communication. We send too many emails. We x, Y and Z fill in the gaps, right? They're going to come up and do that. I like to make an example of somebody right out of the gate for talking either too long or talking while their back is to the audience like I just did. Okay? They need to turn around, face everybody, speak very loudly, very clearly. 5 seconds go. They say it, okay. Boom, they populate this. What I try to do at the end of this, and by the end, I mean I pull from people like, hey, I think a couple of you haven't gone yet. After everybody's gone at least once and we've run out of people in line to go, right, you can go as many times as you'd like, hopefully not more than once or twice at any given turn, get
back in line, go again, etcetera. At that point in time, I go, all right, I need four more. We're not going to move on to the next step until I have four more. And you'll see people writing. Usually you'll grab six or seven more, which is great. Cool line, status quo. Then you take your tape and you say, this represents everything above. This line represents utopia. If we could do what we wanted to do when we wanted to do it, achieve what we wanted to achieve, what would that look like? Okay, so it's in the clouds, right? Imagine this is a mountain. This is the climb from the status quo to utopia on either side, right? You can make your own analogy for this. This is just what I call it. I don't want to go super in depth because I do want to make you to make this your own. After you watch it. Everything up here is the status quo. Everything repeats. You give everybody a second or two to think of one at a minimum. One thing that is utopia. We would be doing this if, or we could achieve that if, et cetera. 5 seconds. They all get in a line, they post them up here. So now you've got a whole bunch up here. Now the challenge of this whole thing is you're going to typically find that there are a million of these, there are a ton of the status quo. And when you get people to do the utopia they won't come up with as many ideas for Utopia as they did for these. And I know you might be thinking, well, isn't that just the opposite?
If we really stink at communication, wouldn't you just say communication? Well, communication might lead to something else which leads to trust, which leads to camaraderie and et cetera. Better culture. Right? So you would write for Utopia. We have the best culture of any company or organization in this field. Boom, that would be utopia. So you're going to need to pull from people, maybe play some music, give everybody another minute. Hey, nobody else is coming up for 1 minute. I want everybody to think as hard as you can get. One more, start the line again. Boom, you got those? Okay, cool. Everything in the middle is the actionable tangible things that get you from here to here, get you from the status quo to the utopia. Now, if you say we're going to, this is just an easy example. If we want to improve communication, you're not just going to put improve communication. This is actionable tangible things, things that you can do today, tomorrow, next week, next month, etcetera. So what you're going to do instead is you're going to go, I want everybody right now to think of much more granular. We are going to start reading a book together on Tuesday. Next week. We'll decide at the end of, you know, this time on this date to read this book. To improve communication, you might need to give them a little bit more than 5 seconds to come up and explain those. Maybe 1010 is enough time for you to give an actionable, tangible solution set of the way ahead. So if we're sending too many emails, like we said, and Utopia is that we're in a groove and we don't have to send all those emails, et cetera, the actionable tangible might be everybody look into the emails that you're sending and determine who you need to remove from the CC line. I said what I just said in less than 10 seconds. It's an actionable tangible thing that we could pick up and move down the field later. Cool. So now everybody puts these in the middle. Cool. I do this at the beginning of a workshop for a lot of different reasons. I already mentioned one of them was building credibility. This is something that can be done in a very short amount of time that everybody visually sees. Imagine we've got 150, 50 down here, 50 up here, 20, 30, 50 in here. Ton of these ideas of where we are, where we want to go and how to get there as just

the starting point of the day they go, oh, my gosh, if we could do that in 20 minutes, 30 minutes, imagine what we'll be able to do for the rest of the day. So I get the naysayers on board really early with an exercise like this, I also use this. I try to record, I ask everybody if it's okay to record the audio from this exercise. And I use this for my report. I write through like, hey, I noticed out of 50 ideas that they put down here for the status quo, you had a theme going, and your theme was 30 of these different ideas or thoughts were negative towards this very specific thing. And I kind of highlight that, right? You'll be able to see that, and we'll have a discussion about those things after doing the mountain or whatever you want to call this.
And I try to tell people during a break, instead of saying, hey, you have a ten minute break, come back, you know, after your bio break, etcetera, I say, hey, you have 15 minutes. And whether you see this before you start your break or after this is part of your break, you need to go up and you need to find your single greatest utopia, actionable, tangible thought or idea and status quo, find your single best of all three, so that when we come back, we can have a meaningful discussion. Everybody's been standing kind of coming up, doing this for a while, so that by the time you give them a 15 minutes break, they're able to put some real thought into what they saw, what they heard, and kind of the body language of everybody else in the room. You know, you can see if somebody's putting something up that everybody agrees to, everyone's going to be like, oh, yeah, preach. Yes. That's exactly what's happening to me. And even though you've had everybody be quiet, right, it's only one person talking. There are grunts and moans. When people say good or bad things, they're like, no, no, that doesn't happen. Or, yes, that's happening all the time. Right? And you get to see it. So anyways, a very, very powerful one. I personally would use this for any audience. You can use this for your family at home to determine where you want to get better, where you want to go on vacation. You can use it for c suite executives, etcetera, and everywhere in between. This is a really good one for everybody to see where you are, where you want to go, and how to get there. This is the mountain."
Sailboating ,Easy,"5-7 participants per group, can have multiple groups","Post-its & Sharpies for each participant, 1 flip chart
with Sailboat template drawn. Make it pretty!",35-60 minutes,"Want a rapid process to analyze any situation with any
group? Sailboating walks a team through the entire
process of the good, the bad, and the ugly in a series of
guided steps that arrives at actionable ideas. Great for
team meetings, status reports, or almost entire group
scenarios!",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732421/lectures/39188385,This is an End-to-End framework (icebreakers not included). Operates similar to the use of the mountain tool.,"Sailboating, a simple end to end problem solving technique for really almost any situation. So what you're going to want to do is first, let's talk number of participants. However many you have, you can tackle it. It's best in groups of five to seven, no more than seven or it gets pretty wonky and slow. So if you do have a bigger group, chop them up, divide them up into recommended five. What you're going to want to do is each group will have their own drawing, simple sailboat. So you can see there's some wind, there's an anchor, there's two different sections. What we're going to want to do is first give everyone post its and sharpies. Each individual should have a stack of post its in their own sharpie. And you're going to prompt them with the following question. A lot of times you can do it as broad as the entire company. If it's a single department or focusing on a specific topic, just focus in with a prompt about that topic. For right now, I'm going to kind of propose or do a simulation of what it would be if you were talking about an entire company. So you're going to propose to them the wind. The wind is what's pushing us forward. It's the good things about our company. So I'm going to get everybody three, maybe four minutes to sit down and write down as many post its as possible about the good things that are happening today within our organization. You'll pause, wait for everyone. Now, it can be three, can be four minutes. What I like to do is eye it, watch how everyone's Sharpie is moving. When the majority of sharpies in the room have stopped, then you know, okay, we're running a little dry. We'll call it maybe give them ten more seconds to finish that last idea. Then you'll have everybody pick up their ideas, come over to what we'll call the sailboating map, and simply put up, well, they'll share one by one, their ideas. I like everybody stand in a semi circle, pick one individual to share all their ideas, and then as we go along, we cluster the similar ideas. What that does is allow us to save time finding the patterns because we're going building the patterns the entire time. So I'm going to repeat that. Everyone brainstorms for three to four minutes. They pick up all their ideas about what's going well in the company, and then they share them. Those could be ideas like lunch break benefits. It could be company gifts that they're giving out, or it could just be the coworkers. A lot of times with the positive, it's a little bit of fluff. It's just a good way to start off. It's really hard to jump straight to the negative for a lot of people and they get really sensitive about it and they don't dive as deep as they need to. So starting with the positive is just a feel good moment. And it's something that we can look back on and say, there are a lot of positives, a lot of good things within the company. Not all of it's bad. Now, when you do ask for the negative, which we're about to let everyone know, we're trying to dive deep, we're trying to figure out the core issues. So share whatever problems and hurdles you're having within the organization, within your department, and be descriptive. It'll be more helpful. So that's the importance of five to seven people, because the more people, the less likely the individuals are to share and the longer it's going to take to get all the opinions.
So problems, they could be as broad as lack of trust, which would change the direction of the workshop. It could just be that there's no snacks in the office or there's silos between departments, or the one we tackle a lot. There's too many meetings now. Too many meetings is still a high level problem that we need to dive deeper in. So once you've allowed everybody to share their good ideas or the positive things and the negative things, what you're going to want to do is create some kind of process for prioritizing the negative ideas. What I like to do is give everyone three to five votes. If there's more than twelve people, I'm confident I can give them three. If there's less than twelve people in the room, I just give them five each. Yeah, so that we can get a decent number of stickies. Give everybody a minute, two minutes to vote. What you'll see is everybody will vote on their ideas. You can move the ideas to show prioritization. And it turns out within this situation, within this fictitious company, lack of trust is the core issue. So with that in mind, with lack of trust being the unique focus that we're trying to solve for the rest of the meeting, we can move on to brainstorming. We'll show you, or you can go to right now, a bunch of brainstorming techniques to use. The most simple one would be put this at the top of a blank flip chart and then ask everyone, how might we solve lack of trust? In the organization. This is a really broad topic. You'll want to get more concrete on what you're discussing. Try and figure out why lack of trust isn't or why lack of trust is an issue altogether. You'll probably have some time for discussions. Break that down a little bit more with another tool. Or if it's something as simple as no snacks, let's figure out ways that we can make snacking easy for our employees. Whether that's a guy that has a little snack cart that goes around and tosses snacks, you know, has a horn or a siren. Snack time, making it an experience. It can be big problems, it can be small problems. But this simple format of drawing out what's in our sales, you know, pepping us up a little bit and then discussing the hard conversations, having the hard conversations with an organized format, it's a simple process to get you from. We're lost and frustrated to we know the problem and we have solutions to it in just 90 minutes. Enjoy."
Zombie Part 1,Medium,"5-24 per group, can be explained to
entire group before breaking into
smaller teams of 5-7 participants.","A board or wall, 7-9 items to “rack and stack” (more
and the process is VERY long), Sharpie, Post-it’s
(recommended), and a group of participants.",10-15 minutes,"Need to get a whole bunch of ideas into something that
is actionable, tangible as efficiently and effectively as
humanely (on not so humanely) possible? This story-
based approach to prioritization can be used for any and
every audience imaginable. Through a non-verbal
process, participants are able to rapidly arrive to a
ranking of options in an emotion-free decision-making
process.",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732421/lectures/39188387,"Before: Defining a path forward.
After: Identifying problems or solutions.","Need to get a whole bunch of ideas down into something that's actionable, tangible, in the now, in the later, in the whatever. Zombies is your tool. I have used this for every audience imaginable, from professionals to people that are into sports to kids to adults, c suite, military executives, admirals, generals, et cetera, all over the place. And it works. I think one of the reasons that this does work is people love stories. They love things that they can relate to. And this is a way to branch your mind away from the really hard task at hand, which is solving this problem or finding out what that problem even is to solve it in the first place. So being able to come up with a story and provide it in the very beginning and get them to kind of buy into that story, it's going to allow them to see their problem through a different lens, and ultimately it's going to allow them to remove emotion from the decision making process. I think that is the most important part of prioritizing anything, especially in a group, to have the buy in that we did this without emotions. We didn't have anybody come in and say, this is exactly how we're going to do it, and we're going to do it this way because I said so. That's not the case with this, not at all. So I'm going to try to speed through the story with you really quick so that you have the gist of it. I'm going to explain the why, who, what, when, where, et cetera. All you need for this one is a board, a wall, et cetera. You can do it on the ground, it doesn't matter as long as you can kind of take what the masses have and rack and stack it. Okay, so I don't like to pick more than, we'll say seven to nine items to rack and stack, but it's up to you. I would not go more than that unless you're willing to strap in for a very long time of waiting, because it will take a long time for people to kind of go through this. So I'm gonna get started. I start by telling everybody that the zombies are coming. It's a zombie apocalypse. There are 3 hours left before the zombies arrive here and it's total and pure chaos. Okay, I'm gonna pause super quick. This doesn't have to be zombies. So while I'm doing this, maybe think of some things that you would use. I've done this with Christmas before and Santa's elves. I've done it with insert blank. It doesn't matter as long as somebody has a problem and it's independent of the person or people solving that problem, it works. It's beautiful, I promise. So here we go. Zombies are coming. 3 hours, right? You have 3 hours to survive the night. Your only objective here, I'm telling this to the audience, the only objective that you have right now is to survive the night. So it doesn't matter what you're gonna do tomorrow. You don't have to come up with this master plan of how you're gonna will smith it over the mountains and make it to the promised land somewhere else. It is all about surviving the night. That's it. So instead of freaking out, you're gonna get real calm and discuss with your significant other, or if you're solo by yourself, what am I gonna do in the next 3 hours to maximize my time and ensure that I don't get totally wrecked or killed by these zombies? So you tell everybody, you throw the very first thing in the very middle, we're going on impact only. This is low impact, high impact.
It's an x axis only. I'm not worried about how hard it will be to get this thing, how much effort it will take to acquire it or build it. It is only the impact that it will have on surviving the night. So if you put that sentence in your head for whatever you're attempting to solve, it becomes easier. This is the impact on solving this. So Johnny talked before about the how might we. So you might have a how might we statement. You have a few categories of ideas of how might we solve x, Y and z. You're going to rack and stack them on the x axis. Gasoline. So you get everybody to nonverbally. Not right now, but you're getting them pumped and primed for this. The next thing that I put up, you're going to nonverbally tell me whether it is more impactful or less impactful than the item that I currently have. So it will be item in my hand versus item on the board. If the item in my hand is more impactful to surviving the night, you're going to put a thumbs up. If it is less impactful, you're going to put a thumbs down. Okay, so this isn't, you know, consider this like an eye exam.
Okay?
This isn't like, oh, my gosh, that's so much more impactful. It's this versus that. This versus that. It's an eye exam. Is a better than b, is c better than a? Et cetera, et cetera.
Okay.
And you do it one by one very incrementally. So the next thing you do, you say you have water. Again, you're telling everybody nonverbals. I don't want you screaming out your idea. On the count of three, everybody vote. One, two, three, vote. More impactful. Less impactful. Generally, you'll be able to read the room and see, okay, at least 60 or 70% of this entire room put a thumbs up. I'm going to do a thumbs up. If it's really close, then count it. Then we go with, and here's the thing, somebody will inevitably jump in and go, hey, did you know that water kills zombies? You're like, okay, first of all, I didn't know that. Second of all, no talking. This is nonverbals, okay? And there's a reason, and I'm going to get to the reason why we use nonverbals for this. It's to move this along very quickly. It's to wrap our minds around something that we can all agree on in the now to move to the next step, and so on and so forth. Okay, food. Start with the one on the left. Food versus gasoline. To surviving the night. Thumbs up, thumbs down, et cetera. They say thumbs down, you move it over here again, inevitably somebody might say, well, hey, you don't need to eat for like 14 days or 20 something days until you die. Um, whatever. Nonverbals. And it doesn't matter. That's another key piece of this. It doesn't matter. I try to get this across. We are using zombies for a reason, to let you know that this is the tool that does not matter. It's what you do with this tool after it's complete that matters. This is just, let's just get through the tool.
Okay?
And you're doing it in a fun loving way because the zombies, etcetera, right? Barricade, I always start with the thing in the middle, because if you're going to compare it to food, everybody's got a vote, then gas. Everybody's got to vote. Then water, everyone's got to

vote. If you do it based on gas, people vote up or down, and you either move it to the right or the left. So here, if they voted it up, you'd go, okay, well, what about water? If they voted it down, you would move water over and put barricade right in between. If it's more, you move it to the right. So let's just say, for instance, it's less impactful than water. You're going to move barricade in where water was move it over to the right.
Okay.
So now I'm going to fast track this alarm swiss family Robinson style. You're going to string up some cans and make sure you can hear when the zombies are coming so you know where they're coming from versus gasoline versus water.
Okay.
You throw it over here. Locks. We're going to lock all the doors. Someone's going to say well zombies don't have opposable thumbs. And you're like, it doesn't matter. It's just more opportunity for you to say it doesn't matter. And if people don't interrupt you, you interrupt yourself and say oh hey, it doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. Locks, gas barricade in between, water. Okay cool. So you're constantly moving these, you're moving them to the left, you're moving them to the right to make one straight line. It's not, this is so much more impactful than that or this is so less impactful than this. It's just, it's a line. It's impact only on surviving the night. It's not how long it will take us to get this. So let's say it will take 4 hours to wait in line to get gasoline but you only have 3 hours to survive the night.
Okay.
This is impact of the gasoline not the feasibility of getting or acquiring the gasoline. Lights go around all the house. Around the house. Turn off all the lights so the zombies can't see you. Apparently they can't see it in the dark. Whatever, it doesn't matter. You make up the story however you want to make up the story and then you put it down here. Okay cool. Everybody has voted so now there is buy in to this tool. The majority have ruled for every one of these. So if it's off, it's not off by that much. If this one beat that one and this one beat that one, the odds of this one beating this one and counting the numbers is significantly more. So it's in the realm of where it needs to be in impact. There's no way alarms are way up here. We don't stop and say well what if you turn your sprinkler system on and water kill zombies? It's gonna blah, blah, blah. That comes later. For right now, x axis only, impact only. Then you move on to feasibility. You say okay, we're going to do the exact same thing, high feasibility, low feasibility. I always make sure that we have the same definition of what feasibility means.
Okay.
Same thing with impact. Let's agree on what we're talking about here. So I say this is easy,

this is hard, this will take a lot of time. This is going to be quick. I want to do it. I don't want to do it, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Feasibility, high feasibility, low feasibility, call it whatever you want, as long as everybody agrees on what that thing is. Two independent variables. One is impact, one is feasibility. Then you hold the thing on the far left constant and just like you did on the x axis, you compare what's in your hand to what's here. Thumbs up means it is more feasible to get food than it is to make an alarm system.
Okay.
And I'm. Everybody would be voting here, right? Nonverbals up, down, you count them. But I'm just doing it. Rack and sack. To show you gasoline versus alarm. You make sure you say that they vote. You should always keep the thing in the same x so that when you're done, each sticky will, you will not run into more than one sticky on the x or more than one sticky on the y axis when you go through this. And if you're not math oriented, if you made a grid with all this stuff, you'd only run into one sticky at any given point. Okay, so barricade again, I don't start at the low one and go up and up. I start at the one right in the middle. So there's three. I pick the one in the center. I compare barricade to making alarms run around the house and throw stuff against all the windows and the doors so that if zombies do get in or have opposable thumb somehow and can get in or pick a lock, you got a barricade there. Okay, cool. They vote up. They vote up again, etcetera. Example, if you're doing locks, the feasibility of running around the house and locking all the windows and the doors is probably going to go really high. But let's say, for instance, somebody, the majority of everybody thinks that barricade's higher. Well, you would leave locks here right next to barricade and then you just move barricade up. So just like the x axis, you're going to move the stickies to get where the boats are. Water, move it down, move gasoline down. You're going to try to do it one sticky at a time in space so that there's obviously one sticky between here and gasoline, etcetera. Okay, again, I'm going super quick. Feasibility of turning out all the lights. Right. It's probably going to climb all the way to the top. You can put a gun in here you can guns and ammo, et cetera, et cetera. There's a ton of stuff that you can do, but you're going to wind up with impact low to high and feasibility low to high. Now, at the end of this, before you start, you go, the purpose of this entire thing was what comes next. So getting here is important. Let's not spend an hour to get here because the meat of this discussion is going to be pulled out now.
Okay?
So have people bear with you. You're potentially not going to do this with 30 people. I've done it with a ton. But ultimately you're teaching them how to do it so that they can go back and do it themselves. So let's say groups of five. You're going to have one person who's going to count the votes, right? So let's say we have two thumbs up and two thumbs down. The person that is counting the votes counts themselves and breaks the tie. They don't need to tell everybody why they broke the tie. They just break it and then it doesn't matter. You try to repeat it doesn't matter so many times throughout this exercise that people get to that

point and break the tie. And break the tie. As a facilitator, I've gone up to a lot of different groups and they're like, well, we can't decide. And I'm like, well, there's five of you. So if everybody voted. Oh, I didn't know I was supposed to count myself. Yes, count yourself. Break the tie. If you have even number of people flip a coin, it does not matter. Cool. You get to this point, you survive the night somehow with zombies. Cool. Now you're going to go into this next phase where you're going to describe and break this down.
Okay.
Hopefully by now you're recognizing that, yes, I use gasoline, food and water and locks and barricades and all this stuff for zombies, but this is impacting feasibility on anything, on our company culture, on our strategy, on our team building for 2022 or whatever the heck it is. Right.
Okay.
This is just to teach them how to do it so that they don't have to take notes because they remember the story. They remember how it all went down so they can do it on their own. I've had people call me years later and say I improved my swimming time because of that zombies thing that you did. Awesome. I always say, like, how did you do that? And they break it down. So this can be individually, it can be for your family, it can be for groups of people, it really doesn't matter. This is just a very good prioritization tool. Cool. You do kind of like a grid here, and maybe you've heard of this before, but it's a pic chart. It's a possible implement, challenge, and kill. I'll say it again. Possible implement, challenge, and kill. There are two more exercises that play off of this one. So at the risk of ruining this video, I'm going to end this one here as part one and I'll bring you into part two. Talking about the pic chart and moving forward with this prioritization matrix. This is zombies, and hopefully I don't have a really good one. I thought I'd come up with something funny about zombies. I didn't. Hopefully you don't get eaten by zombies.
Okay."
Zombie Part 2,Medium,"5-24 per group, can be explained to
entire group before breaking into
smaller teams of 5-7 participants.","A board or wall, 7-9 items to “rack and stack” (more
and the process is VERY long), Sharpie, Post-it’s
(recommended), and a group of participants.",5-10 minutes to complete PICK Chart,"So you’ve picked your Zombie ranking, now it’s time to
PICK your results. Don't let participants know a PICK
chart is about to be completed. If they know the layout
beforehand, they will attempt to game the system to get
their ideas into the implement category. Our goal is to
create a discussion. Use your role as a facilitator to ask
pointed questions and shake out any lingering concerns
of how the cards fell.",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732421/lectures/39188495,"Before: Defining a path forward.
After: Identifying problems or solutions.","So we already went through the zombie apocalypse and we were stuck here at the end with a PIc chart. We said possible implement, challenge and kill. So you can allow, you can skip everything we did before and just do a Pic chart and I'll tell you the pros and cons here. And this can be for a large group, it can be for a small group. It really is dependent on how, how much time you have. I'd say you could do this in about five to seven minutes in a group of five people. So possible implement, challenge, kill, implement are the things that have high impact and high feasibility to achieve top right now I've seen people make impact this scale and feasibility, this scale and high over here and low over there and vice versa. So make sure when you look at this it makes sense to you and you're explaining that to everybody else with the labels because you could get confused based on how everybody has their stuff on here. So possible implement, challenge, kill. Kill would be, hey, this doesn't have very high impact and it doesn't have very high feasibility. So chances are if we're going with the zombie apocalypse thing, we are not going to be able to survive the night and it's going to take too long anyways. So both of those combined don't make for a very good scene here. And then you have the others. I don't like to have people create a pic chart knowing that they're going to create a Pic chart. And the reason for that is people like their idea to receive the praise of we're going to use that idea and they try to get theirs up here in the implement category. What people don't recognize a lot of times is that all of these ideas have some sort of float. Right. They're not exact. These are all sort of, you know, we, we did thumbs up and thumbs down, right? So these are next to each other on the x axis and they're next to each other on the y axis. So who's to say that this isn't even maybe a little bit over here and this is a little bit down or up? It doesn't matter. Again, it doesn't really matter. Going off of if you, if you saw part one with the zombies. So these have a float instead. I like to make the pic chart after the fact. And the reason for that is, let's say somebody loses and their alarm right over here is in the kill zone. In order for them to win their argument. When you get to discussion based, I've got to convince everybody on the impact alone and then once it's over here, I have to convince everybody again on feasibility to get it up to the different quadrant. So you have to win two different arguments. So this prevents the loudest person in the room from just saying, oh my gosh, we have to swiss family RoBINSON this thing and put alarms in the top right? Because now we're going to know where the zombies are coming from and it's going to save the day. So instead do this after the fact, make sure that they have to win every argument so they can't just move this all the way over here. They have to win the argument between alarms and food for impact. Then they have to win the argument from everybody with gasoline. Hey, did you know that gasoline and fire don't kill zombies? Well, if everybody didn't know that, maybe alarms could be better. Who knows? And you're going to learn that from the person that's been there for 20 minutes versus the person that's been there for 20 years based on having that discussion. That's why I say this tool itself doesn't matter.
It's the discussion that happens after the fact. It does. So cool. You do a pic chart. You have a discussion based on where things are, how they landed. Do you agree with them? I think the most valuable thing that you can do with a chart like this in the end is ask pointed questions specific to individuals. So you go over here and you go, Johnny, do you think gasoline is more or less impactful than food to survive the night? And you have Johnny answer that question specifically and tell you why and how and who and maybe tell us some knowledge that we didn't know so that by the time we're done with this, we know a lot more about the problem set, we know a lot more about the solution set, we know a lot more about each other. And we have buy in to what we're looking at at the end. We could look at it and go, yes, I've got full and total buy in to this thing. For some weird reason, people will remember where their stickies landed days, weeks and even months into the future with a group setting like this. So you'll do it and they will remember, hey, this was in that quadrant. It was next to that. And they could almost recreate it. Okay, a lot of things that you can do with this one. I'm going to pause here before I move into part three. This is a pic chart."
Zombie Part 3,Easy,"5-24 per group, can be explained to
entire group before breaking into
smaller teams of 5-7 participants.","A board or wall, 7-9 items already
“racked and stacked”
(more and the process is VERY long), Sharpie, Post-it’s
(recommended), and a group of participants.",15-30 minutes,"One (three) rings to rule them all! Another option for
finding a path forward post-Zombies is the use of 3
concentric rings. The facilitator has the fidelity to adjust
the rings according to how the ranking falls, or simply let
participants decide themselves. Thinking through ratios
of effort, participants will decide which concepts they
should complete Now, Sooner, or Later. Let’s find the
lowest, most delicious, low hanging fruits possible.",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732421/lectures/39188497,"Before: Defining a path forward.
After: Identifying problems or solutions.","We've already done the zombies. We've already talked about the pic chart. Here's another way to look at how things are prioritized and how you move forward when the group is either potentially not agreeing or how do you come up with your roadmap going forward? So a couple ways of looking at this. I like to do concentric rings and it doesn't matter where they are. You can discuss this. You could say, should the ring come down here and come over, should it be sharp and then over to the side, you kind of let the group decide that. Okay, but for now, I'm just going to show you two rings or two curves in some way, shape or form. This can be the now, soon, later today, tomorrow, next week, next week, next month, next year, whatever it is. We already talked about the way that these float. So these could go in or out of those rings. That's why discussing those rings they're showing up is important to have that discussion. Hey, should we bring it down here? Should we come down, cut this one off, etcetera, and allow the group to kind of fight it out a little bit, but give them a finite amount of time to do it. So let's just say draw your rings, everybody. You have three minutes. Go. This allows them to really get in there and like, they're just going to have to make a decision and put the ring wherever it goes. So I like to look at this in ratios because sometimes it speaks to people in the room for them to kind of understand where these things are, the ratios are. We got a one to two ratio, a one to one ratio, and we've got a two to one ratio, one to two. One is, I'm going to put in this much effort and I'm going to get this much more out of it as a result. Two, one to one, I'm going to put in a lot of effort and I'm going to get out what I put in, one to one ratio, two to one ratio. I'm going to put in so much work and effort, and I'm only going to get out a one in results. Okay, now this is where I like to talk about low hanging fruit, because a lot of people have a different idea of what low hanging fruit really is. And you'll hear people all the time go, oh, that's just low hanging fruit. There's almost always the word just before low hanging fruit. Oh, that's just low hanging fruit. Here's the thing, low hanging fruit. You're hungry, you need something to eat, you can reach it. You don't need a ladder. You don't even have to sweat for it. You reach up and grab it and you take a bite. Low hanging fruit is high impact, high feasibility. So next time anybody ever says, hey, that's just low hanging fruit, say, hey, do you know the real definition of low hanging fruit? Depending on what your personality is, don't get in trouble on my accord, but low hanging fruit. Okay, cool. So we have these ratios. We've described it. Everybody knows where these rings are. That still might not be enough for everyone to go, we're going to start doing this today, we'll start doing this next week, and we'll do this next month or whatever it is.
Right. It might allow you to have a meaningful discussion on why these things are where they are and put them in the right and proper category for your own organization with how you're going to accomplish these things or allocate resources to them, etcetera. So there's another way to look at it. And this is kind of the domino effect, right? This is, it's going to get
messy over here, but follow me. One thing might rely on another thing. To rely on another thing, etcetera. So I'm going to move away from my zombie example and I'm going to give you something. So don't read these as I'm circling them. Just kind of think through this. So if you want to improve culture, okay, you're going to need to improve the communication that you have in your organization to do that. So let's say that, you know, it's very impactful to change culture, right? But it's really hard to do. But let's say something that's really easy to do, maybe up here is communication. You're going to do this first. You're going to improve communication, which is directly going to improve or help you achieve a better culture. So even these are, they're in different rings. They're based on each other. We're going to do this, which is going to allow us to do that. And you might even say if we do that, this thing doesn't have as much impact, but it's going to make that a lot easier. And if we do that, it's definitely going to make this a lot easier to do. And so we're not going to do this in today, tomorrow, next week. Instead, we're going to go number one, two, three, and four. These are the four things that we're going to achieve before next quarter. Again, the zombies didn't matter. The pic chart didn't matter. The grids didn't matter, the floats here didn't matter. In the end, what matters is that the group has a common understanding of what each other thinks about two independent variables, the impact that it has on the organization or the individual or whatever, and the feasibility that those things coming together have for the organization. You combine those two things, that's removing the emotion from the decision making process, which allows you to look at something that is seemingly very messy and actually understand what the heck it means and go, hey, our organization and institution is messy, but we have found a way to kind of look through it and we can articulate what we want to the boss or the directors, or whatever you want to call it, the managers to move the needle. And we need this much resources or time, duration, whatever to solve those things or move the needle forward, etcetera. So change zombies to whatever you'd like. Experiment with this one. Start off really small. Do not get in front of a group of 30 people and try this one for the first time. I promise you, you will mess up, even if you are incredible at what you do. Practice this. Practice this with one person or your cat first so you know how you're going to step through it in a group from start to finish. For all three parts of this, I can bring everybody, 30 people through it in about, we'll say 20 minutes. 25 minutes allows me to go through it personally with the zombies. Get everybody to relax, maybe have a stand snack while I'm doing this and they're voting or like a working lunch at the end of lunch, and then have them take their own ideas that they hopefully did earlier in the workshop, put their own categories up here and rack and stack their own categories.
Have them do all of that in under 20 to 25 minutes easily. There are some other things that we can do with this. It is never ending in my opinion. My favorite prioritization tool right here. Zombies."
Triangle Triage,Easy,"3-10 participants per group,
can be multiple groups.","Post-its & Sharpies for each participant, space
to demonstrate Triangle Triage.",15-25 minutes,"User-Solution-Problem. This tool calls upon the expertise
and experience of each individual in the room. With each
participant completing the same template/process, the
group can compare the thoughts of many, identify issues,
and align on common ground. Get a pulse of everyone in
the room and uncover the core concerns early.",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732421/lectures/39188386,"Before: Brainstorming solutions, get more context. After: An introduction to the session.","For this exercise, all you need is a sharpie. Sticky notes for everybody. For the masses. You do not need this. This is just for demonstration purposes. You can, however, use a chalkboard, a white board, you know, a sticky note, a piece of paper. It doesn't matter. Just so you can show everybody what you're going to do, everybody is going to think through this exercise kind of the way that, the way that I show you here, but on their sticky note. Okay, so they're all going to draw a triangle, circle at the top and circle at the sides. Okay, this is a user. This user leverages or uses leverages or uses this solution to solve or improve this problem that the user has. Okay, there's a reason that I don't have this pre done beforehand, because it's a lot. If you just say, this user leverages or uses this solution to solve this problem. Cool, you got it. Go do it. Instead. I slow it down. I write it out. Everyone's kind of confused that I'm going slow, and then I kind of dissect it. Okay, everybody is going to do this on their own post it note, and I go ahead and tell them, so what of this exercise, before we even start, so that they're not confused or they at least have some kind of goal in mind of where they're going to go. Right in the end, instead of me going around this room and saying, what do you think our problems are and what do you think potential solutions are and who are we solving this problem for and what's the root cause and et cetera, et cetera. Instead, everyone's going to write one. We're going to share it in about 15 to 20 seconds each. And in the very beginning of this workshop, we're going to have a very good pulse on where everybody is in the room. And here's the so what. Even beyond the so what is, if everybody writes it in the very beginning, you can't really change it. So hearing from Fred or Susan or Catherine, when it gets to Johnny, Johnny has not rewritten his original thoughts based on their thoughts. These are all raw and organic thoughts and problem sets before everybody kind of dives in. So that's why it's so valuable for this pulse.
Right?
So you say start with the user. Are you thinking about yourself? Are you thinking about the organization as a whole? Are you thinking about a specific person within a team, a specific team, a department, et cetera? That is the user. So take the time to think about what you want to get out of today.
Right.
They're going to have some kind of idea of what you're doing for the day leading into this anyways.
Right.
They had emails and invites to be here. Hopefully you've given some kind of introduction. So what is the user for today for you?
Right.
What are they going to leverage? What are they going to use? So this solution that you're coming up with, there is a reason that we write solution and then problem. We don't just say, this user has this problem and they're going to use this solution to solve it. Instead, you start with the solution and it's a mind shift from we've got these problems and, yeah, we're going to solve it. Check out the hook while my dj revolves it. And I'm kidding. Instead you start out of the positive. You say, we've got this solution or, we've got this idea. It doesn't even have to be good. It's just something that improves the user's experience towards this problem. That's why it's a triangle, because you can kind of go backwards. This user has this problem and we use this solution to solve it for the user.
Right.
This is done this way. Just because it's clockwise, it actually makes sense this way. And it starts you off with a positive mindset for the day. Instead of saying, here are our problems, this is our solution. I've said that before. I want to make sure that it's locked in for you, this user. This is the last time this user leverages or uses or whatever word you want to use this solution.
Right.
You're going to write this solution to solve this problem. Everybody writes it. You give everybody. I'd give everybody about three minutes to really think through this. I wouldn't go more than five and I wouldn't go less than three. It's the perfect amount of awkward time where the people that have it right away, they've got it and that's great. And you're not going to waste a lot of their time. The people that don't, you've given them a chance to really do it. You are going to ask everybody to say this out loud. So if you have, I'd say, more than 25, 30 people, I'd recommend breaking up into big groups.
Right.
You split the group, 15 over here, 15 over there, or however many more you have, just because you're going to end up taking a lot of time out of everybody. You do not have to do this for an entire group of people. You can do it in subgroups. So you explore and then they go to the breakout group that they're going to use for the remainder of the day or the exercise or the workshop. And so they get a little bit more of a taste of what each other are thinking before they dive in and kind of get to know each other a little bit more, potentially, depending on where you put this.

Right.
Again, very, very quick way to get the pulse of the room allows you to put these off to the side after the fact so that you can revisit it at the end of the workshop and go, did we solve any of these problems? What were our problems? Did we get to the root cause of what we said in the beginning of this workshop? Were our users the same, or are we off all over the map on what we think we need to do together? This is usually followed by a very meaningful discussion because everyone is going to hear all these things. They can take notes, you can prompt them. Please take notes while you're listening to everybody, so that when the time comes for us to have our discussion, you can, you know, point out key aspects of what people said, the discussion afterwards. The meaningful discussion is very, very powerful and made better by having all of these kind of on the board or in the pockets of everybody to bring out after a break or something like that. This is triangle triage."
