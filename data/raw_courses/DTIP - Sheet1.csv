Persona-ly. Here's how we play. We're gonna have a Persona. I'm gonna describe it, or John's gonna describe it. The other person's gonna guess.
We're gonna fill in the gap so.
That you know everything you need to know. Here we go. Let's take it away. Number one. This person likes to put their hands.
In everything during the workshop.
They want to have final say on all ideas. They have power outside of the workshop. So they think they have power inside the workshop.
They just want to be the one in control.
Boss. What is boss? Bing bing bing.
That is correct. So let's talk about strategies for managing.
The boss in a workshop before a workshop.
Okay.
Proactive, I think, is always the best. You can talk to them about what you're about to run through, where you want them, because sometimes you don't want them in the scene so that they are actually potentially hindering other people from coming up with thoughts, ideas, or speaking transparently about the organization while the boss is listening.
Social pressure.
That's it. So speaking in advance and saying, hey, are you okay with this? Are you okay with this? Here's my left and right limit of me as a facilitator. What is your left and right limit as the boss so that I can give you in the end what you're asking for.
Love it. I also love the divide and conquer technique. In my experience, when bosses want to control every idea or everyone looks at them to confirm their ideas, put them. Put them in a box, put them off to the side in a group of two, maybe three, their impacts limited to those other individuals. All the other groups will be generating ideas at their highest rate possible. When they get back together, maybe the boss will learner thing or two. See that?
Maybe his colleagues, his employees are much better when they're distanced from him. Maybe he'll realize that, become a little bit better. Regardless, the workshop will get farther because of that little shift.
Yeah. And another thing you can do is if the boss has some certain personality and you can get around his or her colleagues to say, hey, can I throw you in a group with that boss so that you can manage it? I really need your help to kind of keep them away from the rest of the crowd. That's also super helpful.
Bosses, they're gonna wanna be bossy, and it's hard for them to let go of control. So that personal connection with them, that understanding beforehand, I'm gonna be in control of this work. We're gonna be in control of this workshop. Extremely important. So let's talk worst case scenarios. What's a horror story for you on your ends?
Did a workshop, wasn't able to get in touch with the boss. Too many layers of red tape between me and them. And, you know, asked even, can I just speak 15, 515 minutes away from the workshop with them as they're coming in. They showed up late, wasn't able to talk with them, and they showed up. We start the workshop, no chance to have that dialogue. We don't get more than 2030 minutes into the session. I have everything planned out. Everything's going great, lined up exactly how I want it. And then the boss goes, all right, let's move everything to the side. I want to bring everybody into a circle and discuss this. Their own agenda ruined everything. And really there's nothing you can do in the moment there because they're your client or they're your boss or whatnot. There's too much distance between how you were brought on and what they think your role is for you to say, actually, no, we're not going to do that. I highly recommend against doing that, because if they decide to come back and say, get out of here, then you gotta get. You gotta get. So definitely being able to talk with them in advance is a huge priority. It is as important as establishing what their problem is, how you're going to orchestrate the session, your agenda, all these things you have to tell the people bringing you on. I'm not gonna do it if your boss is coming, and I'm not able to have a conversation with your boss.
To flip it in the other direction for another horror story on my end, talking too much to the boss to where they give you so much information.
You plan out an expansive workshop.
They show up, and this is exactly. You have the notes to prove it. You have everything to show that this workshop should achieve exactly what the boss.
Was trying to get out of it.

They show up at some point in the workshop, they decide that's not the problem they want to solve anymore, and they completely. They just won't do the exercise you're going to do. In my case, that was whenever it was, buy a feature for a new, like, feature of an app, they decided, no way we're going to do it. Everybody packed up and left. I fortunately had brutal, you know, four.
Or five workshops in a row with.
Them, and I could adjust my full length agenda according to it. Everyone left frustrated. No one wanted to start the next workshop.
It was an overall disaster that needed a lot of damage control. And a lot of phone calls between workshops. I honestly thought I did everything right. I don't know how I could replay it other than just take it on the chin and readjust. Like you said, they were our client. They had big bucks and we wanted the monies.
Yeah. So what do you do? Have you ever actually used the boss in advance to either do something wrong or use that scenario to help the other people in the room? That kind of thing.
So I personally haven't used that aspect, but I've heard you use it. It's like I teed myself up.
It's like you teed yourself up.
Okay, I'm going to answer myself.
Swing away, my dad.
There we go. So I recommend doing this if you are new to facilitation in general. You get together with the boss and you say, hey, listen, I don't have the established credibility with your people that I'd like to have. And one of the ways to come away swinging is to have you mess up. Look at the first, this exercise. The second exercise, I'm going to ask for a volunteer. I'm going to give the ground rules of what you're able to say or do. And I'm going to say, here's an example. Don't talk for more than 15 seconds, John, and make sure that your back is not turned towards the group. When you do, I want you to have your back towards the group. Speak very softly and just keep talking. So at about the 2025 second mark, when it just becomes blatantly obvious that they have gone past the mark, I'm able to

interrupt them and say, actually, I'd like for you to turn around, speak louder, and you spoke way too long. I need you to cut that down. You've already had that dialogue with the boss. They already know it's coming. They can act surprised, et cetera. But what you're accomplishing there is, I'm in charge of what's going on right now, not in this mean way, but we're all going to respect one another. If this can happen to the boss, it can happen to any of us, and we need to follow the rules. And having them do that has paid dividends in the workshops that I've done.
Yeah. Any little adjustments you can do to kind of push around the boss, just slightly, not poke the bear, but, you know, maybe throw a rock at it. Throw a rock at it. Um, yeah. That's worse than Pokemon. Maybe that's it for this round one of don't take it personally."
Shy Sam,Easy,"Shy Sam-
Characteristics: Tends to sit near people they know, often at the corner seat farthest from the Presentation Screen. Speaks only when directly spoken to and sometimes avoids eye contact. Their worst nightmare is having to stand up in front of the group.
How to conquer it:
1. Speak with “Shy Sam” prior to the meeting [or ask them something via email]. During the meeting, bring up your conversation with “Shy Sam” to the group. This will introduce them into the meeting without putting anyone on the spot.
2. Ask “Shy Sam” a question that is simple to answer and unrelated to the topic. This will give them confidence from the start.
3. Start a conversation, asking for their opinion on the topic at hand. As they respond, increase your physical distance while continuing to listen to their response. As you get farther away, they will speak a bit louder and louder until they end up speaking loud enough for the entire group to hear.

Seasoned Susan,Hard,,https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732452/lectures/39188791,"Explain the importance of timing new ideas. In the late 1990s, a startup was raking in MILLIONS for their novel idea: Deliver groceries direct to your home via internet orders. By 2001, Webvan had filed for bankruptcy. As of 2021, a direct home delivery grocery app, InstaCart, is worth $30 Billion. Right idea, wrong time.
Hit the “I believe button!” - Ask them to trust in the process. A process where some in the room will feel lost at first. Let “Seasoned Susan” know, like a 90’s rom-com, in the end...it’ll all come together.
Keep “Seasoned Susan” engaged by asking for insights into how it went wrong in the past or how we can prevent this new initiative from failing as it once did before. “Seasoned Susan’s” perspective is EXTREMELY valuable.
A “Seasoned Susan” loves to poke holes in a concept, so give them that power. Assign them the role of devil’s advocate and use their super strength for good!","Has been an employee “since the beginning” or close to it. Tends to say, “We’ve tried that before.” Doesn’t like to try new things without poking holes in the plan, which might be disguised as their desire to be perfect. Difficult to distinguish between their hard work ethic and their intrusive nature.",,"Don't take it personally. Sneak peek. Here we go. Here's what we're going to do. I'm going to read the card. I'm going to describe it. Actually, I'm going to make up a description of the card. You're going to guess which Persona it is, and we're going to dive into methods for managing them and helping you make the best workshops ever. Here we go. This individual has many years of experience at the organization. This individual tends to shoot down all ideas because they seen them before or that won't work here. Type attitude. They have an immense amount of experience because of all those years they've been around. Should I keep going?
I think it's a seasoned individual. It rhymes with Susan. I think it's seasoned Susan.
Ladies and gentlemen, in the blurriness of it, you can see it on my chest season. Susan was correct. So how do you manage a seasoned Susan? They, again, expert knowledge of the organization, but they've seen so much that any ideas they feel like they've already seen and it's not worth it.
One, you can treat them like a subject matter expert in the workshop, which is another type of Persona to deal with, which we could talk about another time. But that's where you kind of ask them, why did this not work in the past? Why did this work? What could make something that failed in the past work in the now? What kind of resources do we have that are different now than you had when you went through this and kind of pull at that? You can also do the same type of thing that you did for the boss and kind of seclude them and just kind of push them off to the side just a little bit, which might help.
I like it. I like it a lot. I also think when they're shooting down ideas, teaching them the importance of timing, maybe it wasn't the right people, weren't in charge or any organization at the time to be able to carry it out. That could be a group has an idea about a new app or maybe they have no one to build it, no one to design it, so the idea totally disappears and then leaves a bad taste in everyone's mouth. It could also be the example I always give Webvan. Have you ever heard of Webvan? John, have you heard of Webvan?
No.
No one has because they went bankrupt in the early two thousands. They raised about $94 million in funding. I think it was 2000 when they started that. Here's what they did. Their idea. Beautiful. We're going to use the Internet on the line so that people can order groceries and we deliver them to their house. Bankrupt in two years. Now Instacart is valued at several billion dollars. Does the exact same thing. Not a new idea, not really even a new platform necessarily, but a new level of success. Timing is everything. It could be the world around us that has the wrong setup at that moment. It could be our own organization doesn't have the right people to make it happen. So be patient. This might be the right time

to get that idea in the real world again.
I know there's more about, you know, a specific example of how you might reactively approach this. Right? So say you weren't able to give the right introduction to a workshop or a module, and they don't know you, and maybe they come in late and you weren't able to catch them in time. What do you do if they start kind of telling everybody how smart they are or telling everybody why it won't work because they've been there, they've tried it, or they're saying, hey, it doesn't matter what we do today because we're never going to implement that. I've been around here forever, and we don't do anything new.
That particular one is a tough one. I will say before that when they're shooting down everything, or they come in late and they're already like, this is pointless. Assign them a role. It doesn't have to just be devil's advocate, although that is the role that may fit them the best, because they're already naturally looking for the worst part of the concepts. You can also flip it around and assign every person a role that rotates. That's the six thinking hats that a lot of people do. You can assign this person as the devil's advocate or this person as the ideas person. You can assign each individual a role and make their role intentionally, not the devil's advocate, so that they're not allowed to be negative because that's not their assigned position.
I like, it's kind of the devil's advocate piece is super important when you're coming up with any kind of idea, thought way forward, etcetera, so that you can actually poke holes in a friendly way and say, hey, have we thought about this? Have we thought about that? Can we, can we do this with or without this element, etcetera? And you can pull on that experience to say, where are we going to fail in the future, and how can we prevent that from happening? By truly establishing a good foundation going forward, definitely.
And I think just them recognizing where they are now versus where they were then is going to be a big win. If you're able to help walk them through that. That doesn't mean you need to have them stand up and give a history lesson, but maybe using them as an expert to stand up and talk about specific situations is another role that they could be extremely helpful in. And giving them something to do will give them a focus and keep them from destroying everything. So I think that's all we have time for on this episode of don't take it personally.

I'll look at them, I'll describe them. John will guess them. Then we'll come up with methods for managing them and tell a few stories. Cute little stories. So let's get started. This person never rule breaker.
I read it. I'm sorry. Keep going.
He cheated. This person never does what they're supposed to do. They never listen to instructions. They are playing their own game. You are in their way. They're going to do what they want, when they want. And it is a rule breaker. Literally. John was breaking the rules of the game. Patience.
Nailed it.
Patience. My young viewers and old viewers and middle aged viewers.
Here we go. All of our viewers.
All of our viewers. The rule breaker.
Yeah.
How do you manage someone who just won't listen? And we're not talking about your daughter. She's wonderful. She listens.
Yeah. So it's an escalation.
Escalator.
It's an escalation of somebody breaks the rule once and you have to be consistent. I think consistency is the name of the game for a rule breaker. If you let anything slide on any of the rules that you've put out and that rule breaker breaks them, etcetera, there is no expectation from anybody that your rules mean anything to anyone, which is why I really only give three rules before I start a workshop. Me personally, we're going to start on time, we're going to end on time, and we're going to eat lunch on time because I know that I have to feel out the room for that type of person, et cetera. And I like to be a little different. So being able to manage that is very important and escalating it from when they do break the rule, not making it about them.
Yeah.

So, example I've asked everybody to respect. When one person is talking, there's only one person talking. Example of that. Could be there's some chatter over here and somebody over here is talking. I could go. Instead of pointing at the people that are talking, I go to the person, the people that are chatting, I go to the person that's talking and I go, hey, I'm sorry to interrupt you. There are people talking around here and I can't hear you. Can you do that again? I'm sorry to make you do that. So I put it on myself that I've made them redo what they set out to do. Hopefully they're going to stop. That's my very first. My very first thing. The next one is, hey, there's some talking going on over here. So, you know, I didn't call them out exactly, but I called out at least half the room. And it's like, hopefully they feel a little bit like they are on the spot and then I'll escalate it further to, hey, look, I said this before. I was trying to keep this very light hearted. I wanted this to be fun. I want this to be engaging. But at the same time, we've gotten to the point now where people are interrupting and I'm going to have to get real crazy on you. And I try to make that last part a little funny and go, hey, but the next time somebody talks, I'm going to breakdance fight them in front of everybody.
And I've done this and he's going to do it where I bring them.
Out and I say, we're going to play some music and we're going to breakdance fight. And it is the most awkward thing ever because they don't dance and I break it down all around them and hopefully after that point, they don't break that rule anymore. That was just an example of talking.
No, that is a great approach. I can't breakdance. I can. Me neither. I can dance, but I can't break dance. That makes them so uncomfortable that they won't break the rules again. That is a beautiful, a beautiful approach. A simple approach for maybe those non dancers. Since I hold on to the rules at the beginning and I share them at the beginning. You can also write them down on a flip chart, very large, and have that in a very visible place in the room. And then when someone's talking while someone else is talking, point to one conversation at a time and be like, huh, huh, huh? That annoying sound that sounds like a goat. People respond to that. People respond to that. Or Taylor Swift. It sounds like Taylor Swift. You can point to it. You could take it off the wall and then bring it right in front of them. One conversation. The thing that John and I both, I think, are highlighting is that you exaggerate yourself, pointing them out so that it doesn't feel as serious. There's kind of a sense of humor or playfulness to it, but it stops them from doing what they're doing anyways. Now, if multiple people are talking, I've had everyone just be quiet and turn.
And look at them.
And then we all, like, slowly walk closer and closer to them. It's freaky. It's like a zombie

attack of the individual that's kind of talking too much, but it's a simple approach. Now, maybe the rule that they're breaking isn't that they're talking too much. They're just not following instructions. They need to write down ideas on post its, and it's one idea per post it, and they need to use a Sharpie. They've used a pen, and they've written all their ideas down on one individual post it. How do you help them? Because they're like, I'm not going to rewrite all my ideas.
So hopefully you've caught that before it takes place. What I like to do is after people are dispersing that first minute or two, after you've set them out to go do something, I try to walk around and make sure that we truly have an understanding of what we just laid out. If that happens, I don't want them to rewrite it either, because nobody would want to do that. But I will say to them, look, in five words or less, can you at least sort of capture what each one was or a picture or something, so that other people don't have to read a paragraph to understand this? If not, I'm gonna let your group figure out what you wanna do. But from this moment on, no stickies make it to the wall. No ideas make it out on the surface, unless everybody's are the same. So if you wanna have everybody write with a pen, I highly recommend against doing that. But I'm gonna leave it up to this group. You all can do whatever you do, but I want to make sure you all do it the same way. And what you're doing there is if they can convince the whole group to do what they want. Again, I don't recommend it. You're kind of letting them sort of be masters of their own destiny.
Yeah. Now, if you run into someone who's breaking so many rules that you end up just not liking them, can you get to the point of calling them out or putting them in timeout? Or is that a no go or where you go, hey, sit in the corner, put your nose in that corner, and you need to think about what you did for three and a half minutes, or.
I recommend against doing that. Okay, this is what I do. People are used to me joking around and being silly. And so when I get serious, it gets scary. It gets a little scary. So I can stop and go, hey, look, I am trying really hard to have fun here, because I know the more fun we have, the more engaged we are, the more trusting we can be. Of one another, the safer the space, like, et cetera, et cetera. It all leads to a better end product. But I'm not getting what I want out of a couple of you right now, and it's on me. Maybe I didn't explain it the right way. Maybe I didn't put the right emphasis on what we were attempting to talk about. So we're gonna go on a break. I'm gonna play some music. It's gonna be loud enough, so if you're in the hall and the music cuts off, please come back in. We're gonna start when the music gets cut off again, we're gonna start over. We're gonna start fresh. And I don't mean start the workshop over. I'm gonna give you guys exactly what I need from you. And unless you have a better way of doing it and you want to take my spot, I need everybody to listen to the directions and follow them intently. If you do that serious natured thing, you are allowing them to ostracize themselves by breaking your rule again. And this all goes back to what I said in the beginning about escalation. Start funny if you're funny. If you're not funny, do whatever your personality dictates that allows you to ramp that up to

stop them. Because if you let them continue to just walk all over you, it is not the sign of a facilitator that I want running a session, because you're wasting everybody else's time, energy, efforts, et cetera. By allowing that person to break the rules when we all have to follow.
Them, one bad apple can ruin the bunch. And there are plenty of studies. The one that I like the most tells the story of they put an implant into groups. So these people were going to work on group projects, and they put one person in, and they gave him a different role each time. One, he was extremely positive. One, he was, like, just apathetic, I guess. He wasn't energetic and just quiet. And the last one, he was negative. Now, the positive one obviously helped the group. The apathetic one, the group slowed down slightly. They did slow down. It ruined some of the things with other people able to pick up the slack, and it made a few of the people more positive and more proactive. Interesting. The negative one brought three of the. Well, two of the other three. So three of the four people also became negative, and they got almost nothing done. So one person can ruin a group of four easily. The same goes for one person in a workshop. They can tear down the house. So, rule breaker, the earlier. You can deal with setting up the rules, setting up a flow, establishing that they are going to follow what you create as the rules in this space, the better, because it's going to have a huge impact on the end result. Even if it's just one person. Definitely one moment is okay, but one person the whole time is not.
Yep. I'm going to wrap up what's in my brain by saying a proactive approach to doing this is purposely have somebody break the rules and purposely tell everybody how you're going to interrupt that person when it does happen. Because somebody, you get caught up in it. And if I've asked you to talk for 5 seconds, 7 seconds, 10 seconds is okay. If you're talking for 15, you've gone over overboard of what I've asked. Have somebody, another facilitator or the host or somebody during a break. Hey, I'm gonna ask you to do something. I'm gonna call you out. I want you to break all the rules. They're in on it. Show everybody what it's like when you do interrupt them and it becomes more of like a game. Like, ah, he's breaking the rules.
Exactly.
You know, and now you have other people facilitating on your behalf, which makes your job easier. It makes everything run smoother. It makes everybody have a better time.
Yeah. It's not like a tattletale.
Yes, sort of is sort of a tattletale.
Yeah, but a fun tattletale. It's a wagging tattletale.

Sure.
It's happy. Okay. So don't take it personally."
Engineer Brain aka Gearhead,Medium,"Engineer Brain-
Logic rules everything. Feeling out of sorts or unfamiliar with a process drives them crazy; often so frustrated they end up silent or yelling like Milton from Office Space. They need order, a designated series of steps, and a reason behind everything before they commit to opening up their mind to opportunity.
How to conquer it:
1. Explain the process we are going through was established by Stanford, Google, and IBM. These “namedrops” will serve as some initial credibility.
2. Provide a loose agenda to be reviewed at the outset of the meeting. This will provide some additional security to “Engineer Brain”.
3. Find a way to show outcomes early on. These outcomes will lead to their buy-in.
4. Prepare to timebox the participants. Engineers like to work until the product is at 100%
completion. Timeboxing will help you establish when you’ve reached “good enough”. Again, you’ve already provided the outcomes of the meeting, so your “good enough” should align very well with that.",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732452/lectures/39188796,"Explain the process we are going through was established by Stanford, Google, and IBM.

Hey, it's really good to have you on the show. Pleasure.
I'm going to ask you a series of questions or thoughts. I'd like for you to guess what I'm attempting to ask you because I clearly don't know. Maybe you're a better host for this in the future, but for now.
This.
Is someone in a workshop or a meeting that needs to know when things are happening, in what order. What is the process behind this? That and the other. Exactly where does this fit in to the grand picture? They're basically looking at what you're doing through a, you know, a microscope and they want to know what's about to happen and why does it matter and et cetera.
And they don't want to control everything.
Correct.
Okay.
So the key words I took out process order, like to know everything. So I'm going to go with engineer brain fan.
Fantastic.
Fantastic. So dealing with an engineer brain, they love process. They love being able to see ahead and understand where they're going. They probably don't know how to do that because they're in a new setting. It's a workshop. They probably haven't been to one. So they're grasping. It's like they're floating out in space and they need something to hold onto. So give them some. Something to hold onto. That can be an agenda where they can see where we're at. You can also scratch out so they see our progress. You can do a micro exercise that actually walks them through the process. I think that's a great technique so that they can get there, buy in early and they believe, okay, we did a 30 minutes version of what this workshop could do. So I trust this person, that they're going to be able to connect the dots enough to guide me through this process that I have no idea about. What other methods you got?
We haven't been using the microphone. Hopefully that audio actually came through.

Yeah.
So as far as this person goes, how do you deal with it? Do you have any kind of stories where you haven't really established what you just said? They don't know where they are and they want to know deeper. Like you finish a module or you finish something that you do some kind of exercise and then you say, okay, and the reason we did this is because of blah, blah, blah, and you're about to move on to the next thing and they go, well and they ask you a question that throws you off. Have you had a horror story like that, anything like that?
I've had definite examples of that. So I'm gonna literally talk about engineers, computer engineers. I've had a group of ten computer engineers trying to figure out how they're gonna organize their database as a workshop. To me, it didn't make sense at the time. It did, in the end, turn out good. How I got their buy in was I understood they were an engineer brain, and I understood what they thought was valuable. So I gave examples. I researched examples of when workshops design thinking was applied to data, to data science, and was able to give examples in their language and stories that would interest them so that they could feel more validated. So that was one. I also gave them other videos, short, short videos, not long at all, and an agenda before the workshop even started because they tend to want to have all the information possible. So they would watch those videos and at the beginning set it up for answering questions about what we're going to do, why we're going to do it, who else is using the same type of technique, say Google or, I mean, you could probably pull a name out of a hat of a tech company, and they're using workshops. So establish that credibility with them that they can trust the process, and then later on, they'll trust me. So trust the overall process first, and then trust me.
Okay.
So the takeaway that I have from what you just said that I think is huge for anybody out there attempting to. To bring their game to the next level or their level to the next game. I said it right the first time, is that they're looking for something to grasp onto and you want to give them something to grasp onto. It might not be the whole enchilada. It might just be a little appetizer, a little taste, so that they know and feel comfortable where you are, where you're going, et cetera. They know that you've got your hand on the wheel and you're driving towards the right direction.
Right. If you don't put out a visual agenda, if you don't give them any context as to what are the steps and why are we taking them, which, before each exercise module tool, explain why we're doing it and what the expectations are afterwards, highlight what we were trying to do and how we achieved it. It'll gain their confidence little by little as well.

Excellent. We're completely out of time, and the commercial has already begun."
Me First!,Easy,,https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732452/lectures/39188797,"A simple rule. No one is allowed to vote for their own idea(s). State aloud, “For this round only, you can’t vote on your own ideas.” This helps put a cushion on democracy by preventing a single individual from impacting the entire outcome of the group. If you need more voting tactics, check out voting tricks/tips in our course “Voting.”
Point it out. What’s the why? Ask them directly if the end result is due to personal interest or business progress. This ‘call it as it is’ approach is to set the stage for conversation. The question must be posed correctly or you’ll end up accusing and not improving the situation.
Let them self-destruct (in a meaningful way). Allow them to break down in order to build up by defining characteristics that impact the prioritization of ideas. Is it cheaper to make? Is it less frustrating? By adding details, you can help mitigate the impact of the overall Yes vs No and get more granular.
Don’t leave votes on the table. Literally, don’t leave out dots for voting to prevent any temptations for inflation (of results).","“I” before the “we.” This individual is so accustomed to fighting for resources, they can’t help themselves. They want their ideas to be the ones selected. Whether it’s taking extra votes from the table, or trading cookies for prioritization, they want their ideas first. Even if the concepts aren’t the most important for the business, this individual wants any idea which makes their own life/department better to be done FIRST.",,"Welcome to your favorite game show. Don't take it personally where we help you figure out how to facilitate the most common funky individuals that you may find in your workshops. I've got a card. It's got a Persona. I'll describe it. John will guess it. Then we'll give you master tips on how to tackle any problem or any Persona. Let's do it. Boom, boom, here we go. This individual, they will always try and maybe take the extra votes off the table and put them on. Their end result is the same. They want their ideas to be the ones that are executed. Even if maybe they're not the most important for the whole business. It's theirs. Me, me, me, me, me, me might be giving away too much. They want to be the person that gets all the progress, and they don't want to share it with anyone else.
They want the idea. They want to own the idea.
They don't want to own the idea. They want whoever votes in the group. That doesn't matter. They want their idea to be the one that gets the yes so that it turns into a reality. Doesn't have to be their idea, but it has to help them.
I am not as good at naming Personas as you are. Can you tell us the name that you've chosen? And I'll walk down that path.
Me first. Ah, it's called me first because they want their idea first in their department.
So what to do, how to manage it, et cetera. Super easy way. You are not allowed to vote for your own idea. That stops a lot of people in their track. There are different tools, tips, and tricks that we will go over in other modules, or you'll see it at a later time where maybe you've already seen it, where depending on where you are on the line, where you say, look, for this round only, you are not allowed to pick your own idea. And if they get upset, you go in the next round, you can. But for the very first one, we need to see where everybody's thoughts are at. We need to see where the group is thinking and where that momentum is being pulled or pushed so that we can make a call whether or not to do it again. And then we will have our opportunity to vote for our own. But for right now, you can't.
I think that's the most straightforward way you could possibly handle it. Obviously, a lot of the stuff I say obviously, maybe it's not always obvious. A lot of the stuff we say can apply to different situations. Stopping, pointing it out, being transparent. Hey, is this idea for your department. Is that the motivating factor? Are other ideas more beneficial to the business overall than just individual departments? And if so, should we vote that way or just kind of call it what it is? A me first is a me first. Yes.
So another way to look at this is attempt to remove emotion from the decision making process. You can do that by voting where even if they do vote for their own, they see that they're the only one that voted for their own or the group does, et cetera. Sometimes it's

best to let people self destruct in a meaningful way, which you can orchestrate if you are a medieval genius.
Sometimes you got to break them down to build them up.
Sometimes. So various tools that allow you to add layers. So it's not like, is this better than that? But is this cheaper than that? Will this be faster than that? Will this be more frustrating than that? You add these different layers so that they might win the argument here or there, but the chances of them winning every argument to make their idea the single greatest thing becomes harder and harder to do over time, especially in small groups, that they're not going to be able to do it without almost calling themselves out and saying, all I care about is myself.
Variety of tools out there for prioritizing ideas. I think you can put them through several of them, several filters. Whether it's a game of knockout effort, impact scale, straight voting with dots. You can do crazy, crazy voting where it's voting on multiple aspects of it, whether it's ease of getting it done like that for impact scale or complexity of the actual something that's inside of it. You can assign various values to various colors and then vote all together. And you have a rainbow of colors that's pretty to look at, but also gives you really good insight into what people are thinking. Whatever you want to do, you want it to be structured and you want it to be not able to be games. So don't leave, literally, don't leave votes on the table because an individual might pick them up and put them on. I've had that happen.
Yes.
And I was wondering why there were so many votes. If you give someone too many votes, they'll skew the whole entire thing. You say, okay, you can vote two dots per post it, and that's okay. Well, then I watched someone put five dots on an individual post it. It skews the whole results to where this single post, it looks important amongst the others. Even though we all voted, one individual is the real reason that it raised to the top. So it's not realistic. It doesn't reflect what actually needs to be done.
So you're doing some of these in person, but if you do virtual mural allows you to see how many people voted on a very specific one. So you can almost get around that. And so if you think that this is going to happen to a group that you're doing something for, figure out a way to do it anonymously, figure out a way to do it so that votes actually come to a single point on the team that adds those points together and is able to take out any outliers that are not following the rules in that respect. But to get rid of the my idea, my idea type of thing, the simplest thing that you can do is say that you have to build someone else up. And if your idea is that good, that other people are building you up, that's how you win. So you need to be able to convey your message to your team well enough for them to actually

select your idea. Because you selecting your own in front of everybody else does nobody any good.
It doesn't. It does not get buy in from the group on that idea either. That individual may be very excited about it, they may be a little bossy, they may be any of the other Personas we mentioned combined into one. You just need to let them know by forcing their idea to the top. That doesn't mean it's actually gonna be the one to get done.
Don't take it personally.
Don't take it personally. Me first. I said it first."
Negative Numpty,Medium,,https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732452/lectures/39188799,"If possible, use humor to defuse the situation and ask for trust. They don’t have to refrain from saying “no” for the entire session, but just for this exercise. Assure them there will be time dedicated to feedback once finished.
Ignore them. If the workshop is designed correctly, negative participants should eventually find value in the process and become supporters. No’s will dry up as engagement and collaboration increase.
Show of hands. Ask the group to vote on how the session is going. This high risk move can spark immediate conversation. Encourage those who aren’t enjoying the session to share their ‘why.’
Call it out. Bold but very beneficial. The impact of one negative individual is astounding. Speak to the individual directly. “Let’s put all the weight of failure on me. If this process doesn’t work, it is my responsibility and my failure. But it’s only mine if we try. So let’s be open  -- let’s be yes-and not 'no, never.' Then, at the end of the day, we can meet back up and see where we’ve landed.”","This individual doesn’t seem ""in it to win it.” They like to shoot every single idea down. They might not be an expert on everything, but they are an expert of “NO.” Their dedication to the prevention of progress can stem from many reasons: They’ve had many years in the industry and have grown pessimistic.

Whatever the varied root cause, the result is an unwavering, monstrous… NO.",,"Bright lights. Bright lights in the new city. Here we go. Don't take it personally. America's. America's the world's favorite game show for facilitators on the Internet. Made by us. Okay, so let's dive in. In this show, here's what we do. We walk through a Persona that you commonly run into your workshop. I describe it. I've got it listed here. John guesses whose it is. And then we will give our best tips that we've uncovered for managing these types of individuals. John, I guess I'll describe it now. Are you ready?
I'm ready.
This individual likes to shoot everything down. They may not be an expert on the topic, but they are an expert on. No.
Not k n o w. They're n o.
Not knowledge, but no.
Hmm.
There are no ledge.
This person is a negative numpty.
Numpty. Sorry, british people. Yeah, that's my boy, bruv, isn't it? Accent. Negative numpty. How do you recognize a negative numpty? How do you know they're different from other Personas? And then how do you manage them?
Sure. So you recognize this by someone that is not in it to win it. They do not want to follow the agenda. Nothing that you say pleases them in any way. And it's not necessarily about them or the team. They just don't like anything that's going on right now. And again, it's not the ideas. It's the way we got the ideas. It's the module or the point in the workshop that we're asking them to do. Why are we using these? I don't want to use those. And I want to use a pen instead of this. And it's not necessarily a rule breaker. It's just everything that they want to do is the opposite of what you're doing.
They're the worst.
Yeah, they are the worst.
So any nightmare stories where this negative numpty.

I think we're so close to the end of our current day that I don't want to have nightmares. So I'd prefer not to tell you some of those stories, of which there are many.
Okay. Do you have any, you know, everyone just agrees with me all the time. No, I'm a middle child. I was constantly surrounded by no's. In a workshop, you've got an individual who just does not want to agree to anything at all. How do you manage them? I honestly throw humor at everything. So it's an unhealthy thing that I do. Protective measure, I guess, to try and convince everyone to like me enough to do what I say is essentially what I'm trying to do. So most of the time, almost all the time, I have enough charm. I don't know where it comes from. I have enough charm to convince them to me, the pied piper. And they're the mice that follow me. Did he have mice or children?
I got it. Okay.
Well, people follow me. People follow me. Now, when a negative person comes in the room, a lot of times, whatever Persona they are, I'll call them out on being that type. Say, wow, if I told you no, I asked them, like, what's your favorite dessert? Now, if I told you I could get that for you right now, what would you say? They'd be like? No. See? Negative numpty. Call them as they are, lean into it, and then try and figure out a way to entertain them. I also think you just ignore them, and then eventually they become believers, because the process works. If you have the workshop set up correctly, at least halfway through, they're going to realize that there's value to it. And even though they are negative and they may be bringing some people down, if there's a way you can isolate them so that that energy doesn't spread throughout the group until they get to the point where maybe it's just a partnered exercise and they start seeing the value of it, and then they believe in it. You just have to get to that breaking point where they start believing it doesn't happen for everyone. So if you recognize it's not going to happen, here's the moment it was supposed to happen. Now looks like it's not going to happen. Let's just keep this person isolated. It is hard whenever you have someone that's just not into it.
We've said this before, this plays in directly to this negative numpty that changing their mind might have an impact that is forever lasting, ongoing forever, because you were able to, one, get to them, and, two, be able to get to the people that they work with, and so hang in there as long as possible to try to get that person to kind of understand where everybody else is at. You can do this as a. Not like a slap on the wrist or anything like that. You can do it as a quick vote or something like that. Where. This is where the rest of the group feels that we are right now. We got a couple outliers out here. Does anybody care to. And like you said, lean into it. Does anybody care to tell us why? And sometimes, and you've got to be very confident in yourself, if this, if you do this, what I'm about to say, really, truly lean into it. Why don't you want to do this? Well, it's wasting our time. Okay, well, all right. Hey, I don't want to waste anyone's time. I'm not here to waste anyone's time. I mean, do you have a better way of doing what we're doing? And they'll likely go, yes, I do. And, hey, what is it?

What would we, you know, etcetera. You're going to have to kind of wing this one to find out where this goes. But I'm willing to push those as far as I need to go to prove a point that will matter after I have long left, which is ruthless, which is, hey, sometimes you need to be open to other people's ideas. You need to be open to other people's processes. And whether you know it all or not, be a participant, be a team player. Sometimes you can make a group covenant. It's like, these are the things we're going to do with each other, for each other, by each, etcetera, and go reflect on that covenant and go, are we doing that? Are we living up to what we said we were gonna do? No. Why not? Who's not?
And you can try and pull other levers before you get there. Yep.
This is a really rare opportunity for your opinion to be heard. Now, if all everyone is gonna share is no's and negative, then we're not gonna be able to create anything new. So we wanna have open opinions, open opportunities, and we'll have a time for judging. We will. There'll be a vote. There'll be a prioritization. We'll have a time for that. But right now, it's the problem space. We're trying to break it down. To get to the solution space, we'll have to do some other stuff. That's true, but it's not the time for us to shoot it down. So let's be open. Let's try and make it through the process. And then I can see you're an expert at analyzing. Say you're an expert at being negative. You're an expert at analyzing. So I think your opinion and insights are going to be really valuable when, when we get to that stage. So if you can hang in there until then, you're going to help me. You're going to help every individual in this room. And that would mean a lot. I know, for my success. Cause I don't want to screw this up.
I thought of another thing that works very, very, very super.
Well, okay. Was the thing written right there? I'm just kidding. There's nothing behind the camera.
We should turn it around so you.
Can see there's nothing in there.
Is that sometimes I say, I am so open to your feedback. After we finish this module. Yep.
If we finish this module and you still think that it was a waste of time, didn't accomplish what you wanted to do, did it in too long of a time period, or you just didn't like it in general,

or you still have questions or there's a lot of, you know, pitfalls in what we're working on. I'll have a retrospective when we're done with what we're working on right now, but for now, I need everybody to get in line and do it. You got to obviously be confident that what you chose for the moment will accomplish what you did. But you also have to be willing to accept that they might interrupt after it's done and say, that was terrible. We could have done it faster, et cetera, et cetera. So it depends on your personality. It depends on this group. Most of these answers depend. But if you're ready for it, you know how you're going to act and react to the situation, and in the end, they won't take it personally.
You won't take it personally. And that's when we all say, don't take it personally. Hi, mom."
Mine. Mine. Mine,Medium,,https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732452/lectures/39188825,,,,"Boom. Don't take it personally. Rule nine, take one.
Don't take it personally. The fan favorite show where John and Johnny tackle Personas that you commonly face in workshops. I've got a Persona in my hands. I've got many. Focusing on one. I'll describe it. John will probably cheat, and we'll come up with methods and management styles for this particular person. Here we go. This individual is terrified that every bit of decisions that come out of the workshop will be their responsibility and their team will have to carry them. They shoot ideas down because of that fear. They kind of push everything away because they already have way too much work, or they feel like they have way too much work or they don't want to miss their deadlines. They don't need anything else, and they're afraid whatever happens is gonna be their responsibility.
I do not have a clever name for what I think this person is, but I'm going to describe what I think they are.
You're gonna describe based on my description?
Yep. Describe this person is a. They are getting in everyone's way, including their own, from creativity. What did you name it that'll help everybody?
I called it mine, mine, mine. Because I think every single decision is going to be their own responsibility.
Got it. So when we come up with an idea and everyone's really excited about it, and they realize that the burden of that idea is going to fall on them, they want to shoot it down because they know. They know that it's gonna make their life miserable on the other side.
They know. They know.
So a huge element of this is company culture, team wide culture. And being able to convey those thoughts and trust your colleagues in opening up about that is going to matter significantly in the long run. So I wouldn't want everybody to come up with a million ideas either if I knew I was going to have to do all of them. But I could manage some expectations in saying, look, I'm the only one that does this thing, or, I have a team of only five people and we already manage this and we're falling behind. We can't add anything to the plate without removing something else. So I'm happy to dive down this, but we either need more resources or I'm going to need help from other people in the organization. Now, how do you get that person to say that or do that?
Spidey senses. First step. Spidey senses. You have to be able to sense their discomfort already from the moment the ideas are coming out, you can kind of. Maybe they're tapping

their fingers more moving their feet more, pulling out hair. Maybe they're standing on the table screaming. There's got to be some kind of giveaway that this individual is stressed. Sometimes you can't get them to say it out loud, and you have to pause. We're coming up with a lot of ideas. Are these all resource heavy? In one department, do we only have certain individuals? Is there a bottleneck to our ability to actually get these ideas done? Present that question to the group that gives that individual the door completely wide open to share their stress with me, teeing it up for them so it doesn't feel like they're just coming out on their own. It's more like they're being a good participant. They're sharing where they see fit, and they're also able to kind of relieve some of those stressors.
So I'm gonna give an example of something that happened in a workshop of mine that I think was just a beautiful thing. We were. Everybody was just ragging on. I can't believe we don't get this in time and we don't get that in time, and we're never gonna be able to do this. And all this stuff, it all related to one department. And we got to the point where. Where this woman came up to the front as nice as could be and just said, I'm the only one in my department that does all this, and I'm significantly overwhelmed. And everybody flip of a switch went, oh, my gosh. Like, that's why we don't get in on time. That's why we get upset when we don't get what we want. And really, we're thinking about it the wrong way. How can we help you help us? As opposed to, why aren't you helping us? And so something that you can do that I think is super powerful with a mind mine or whatever name you want to call this person is to join their team as the facilitator. You back them up, and you try to get the rest of the team to figure out a way to make these ideas stick so that you're at the root of the problem one. And so that you are actually looking out for everybody, because it does nobody any good to conclude a successful offsite or retreat or a workshop for it to come crumbling down on one person who. Who wants to just quit. And so figuring out a way to do it collectively as a team could potentially start as you, as a facilitator, just sticking up for them and asking the rest of the team how we can get around that.
And you should have things built in to prevent ideas moving forward that aren't actually able to be done. Because if an idea actually causes more problems than it's not near a solution, you really don't want an idea to cause problems. It'll probably cause friction, but you don't want to make the idea worse than the existing solution. Makes me think of upstream. If you haven't read it, it's a good book. Go get upstream. There's two friends sitting by a river. They notice a child is coming down river and struggling to swim. One of them jumps in, swims over, saves him. By the time he gets back to shore, they notice another kid in the water. He jumps back in and swims, comes back. It happens a third time, jumps in, swims back. When he gets back, there's another kid in the water, and the friend is. One friend's taking off and the other one's out of breath. He's been swimming back and forth. He's like, where are you going? Like, I'm going to find the guy who's throwing the kids in the river. Right? So they're solving a problem, but they're not solving the root problem.
I love that.

And there are a ton of incredible examples in that book that you can pull from to give and then ask, is this idea going to cause more problems? Is this the root of everything or what's going wrong here? Or what could go wrong here that we're missing?
So this person could potentially borderline a mind mine. They think everything's going to fall on them. And a potentially on the other side of that spectrum, where they don't want to accept any of these ideas because they don't have control over that idea. So it's mine. And how dare you tell me how to do my job right? A big element of this that you can do is bring out a meaningful discussion. There are few things in a workshop more powerful than a truly open conversation, where everybody has an equal say in where you are, where you want to go, how you're getting there, etcetera, and opening up to the group, generally with a large audience. You don't want to do this because people will get lost and tired, but you can do it in small groups and then share out from those small groups. Hey, what were the key aspects that we brought out of this group to share with everybody else? Some of those issues will bubble to the surface in that way.
And I'm big in frameworks, and if there is any way that I can set up small test pretotyping a trending word right now to let multiple ideas be tested so that maybe that do it all person can be happy. And the mind mine person can be happy because it's not a full load of work. It's a two to three week mini version that just proves this idea is more valuable than the other. And that can help us narrow it down. Narrow it down as well, without having to put so much pressure on one individual.
Yeah, I love it.
What else?
I think that's everything.
Yeah, that's all mine. Mine. Don't take it personally. We'll see you next episode."
All or Nothing,Hard,,https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732452/lectures/39188827,"The ONE THING. A strong tactic but useful is to force the individual or group to decide on ONE THING. “What’s the one idea you can’t live without?” To do so, use a voting tool to allow each individual to prioritize the opportunities at hand and openly discuss the results. Allowing each perspective to be heard and adding context to all decisions.
Overwhelm and adjust. If the group wants to do it all, show them the future. List out each idea, then define all the factors which could impact it: What will we need to start? Who will be in charge? What dependencies are there? By seeing so much information, the group will be forced to face reality: this is TOO MUCH. Make them trip on the truth.
Is this a shiny object? SQUIRREL??? Call it out for what it is. Literally, call it a shiny object or squirrel. We all want to solve as much as we can, but sometimes we need to focus on the macro or micro. Let’s recenter, let’s focus on the main task of the day.
Explain the car vs effective transportation. If we start now, with our resources, we can manage to build the body of a car. It won’t have an engine. It won’t be able to transport us anywhere, but it will look “lovely.” If we start with a skateboard, we can still move faster than walking. Then eventually we’ll turn it into a scooter, a moped, and eventually an incredible car. If we start with a car, we (ironically) end up immobile.","A romantic at heart, this individual can’t stop themselves from thinking ALL IDEAS are incredible, hoping to “boil the ocean” in a single meeting. Despite limited resources (time, money, people), they want to put every idea into action. Highly intangible, the result of “selecting it all” instead of prioritizing the most promising is a lack of focus, progress, and excitement amongst participants.",,
En Garde,Medium,,https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732452/lectures/39188829,"Anonymity. Our goal is always to allow each individual to have their own voice. However, to do so, anonymously sharing can be a cloak of transparency in a guarded group. This openness can be the bridge that leads to meaningful conversations. Taking the focus to “we” instead of “I”.
If it sits, it fits. Decide where people sit. By intentionally deciding where each participant sits, you facilitate interactions & discussions. Make a note to sit the guarded away from their “inspiration” and allow them space to create on their own.
Meet the makers. Before the workshop begins, potentially days/weeks before, meet with the decision-makers who will be in attendance. Ask for context about the attendees and their habits. At the workshop kick-off, call out the more proactive sharers of the bunch and highlight good actions. Rewarding attention can act as enough social proof/motivation for “the guarded” to be willing to open up.
Mix & Match. If multiple departments show up, do not let their managers workshop in their own department. Flip the managers or bosses into a new group. By doing so, we allow their experience & knowledge to be used while still keeping each group comfortable & open to sharing.","You may find them sitting next to their boss, but one thing is certain: this individual shrivels up in the presence of authority. Despite their own capability to create, they turn into a Mime, mimicking the opinion of others instead of sharing openly. Whether it’s copying post-its or asking “what should I vote for?” -- they are very guarded with their own thoughts.",,
Give me your Tired,Medium,,https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732452/lectures/39188830,"Space out. Most likely the group has been working hard from the same physical location. Get them out of there! Allow time for participants to recover individually by giving them 20-25mins for a ‘walk-about’ away from the table. Whether walking or just finding a space to be alone, this should give each person a reset.
If the participants have been active and on their feet all day, they may be physically tired. To revamp, allow them to take a seated break. This will, almost certainly, relax them but also result in sleepy/groggy participants. After 10mins seated, use an Icebreaker or Energizer to get the room back on track.
Let them be. If it’s a single individual, they may not be a bad apple but a plastic one. They aren’t contributing to the session, but they aren’t taking away from it either. As a facilitator, it’s hard to know the ‘why’ behind their exhaustion. There could be other issues weighing on their mind you won’t be able to help shake.
Point to the finish line. If the workshop can’t be pushed back or extended, show the participants how much is left. Transparently share the amount of time/effort left to complete the session. Highlight that it may not be fun, but it will be necessary and we will get the result we desire. Together, the finish line won’t be too far away. Also, sugar & coffee.","Ever tried to run a mile in sand uphill in a dust storm with 50lbs strapped to your back? This individual or group feels like that sounds: exhausting. Slow to respond, but also slow to engage, this participant(s) is contributing little to the session outside of a body in a seat. Mentally, maybe physically, they are tired.",,
Co-Facilitator,Medium,,https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732452/lectures/39188854,"Talk it over. Their experience could be extremely helpful, when used correctly. Have a 1-on-1 conversation off to the side where you recognize their expertise and energy, but need their trust. Today is your workshop, and you appreciate the tips. However, you need support and participation.
Sink or swim. If the session is divided into multiple groups, allow the “co-facilitator” to follow their own drumbeat within their group. Give them the time limits placed on the other teams but allow the individual to guide their team with their own process.
The Teacher’s Pet. Instead of isolating, get the individual involved. Ask your “co-facilitator” to take notes on the conversation. Assign them specific tasks, such as organizing the post-its, keeping track of time, etc. This will allow them to feel engaged without interrupting the workshop flow.
Objectively objective. In workshops, one can either be the facilitator or be a participant. Being both blurs the line between objective thinking. Highlight this to the individual. By attempting to assist in facilitation, they lessen their ability to contribute thoughts & knowledge to the conversation as a participant.","The backseat driver of workshops. This individual has run meetings before and is comfortable leading the team. In fact, it feels like they want to be in your position, ready to swoop in and ‘help.’ As much as they want to facilitate with you, they (at times) think they can do it better. They may undermine your agenda to guide their own team as they see fit, or question your decisions in front of others.",,
My-Job,Medium,,https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732452/lectures/39188856,"Avoid it completely. Before the workshop starts, RUN! Kidding, during preparation, meet with stakeholders to understand the direction and intention of the session. Transparently share your own fears and see if more context into the situation gives you more confidence to move forward.
Redefine ‘work.’ Instead of viewing a successful product/process as reducing labor needs, highlight that it only shifts labor. Less hours on a repetitive task can mean more hours on more engaging and creative work.
Transparency is key. If, in the workshop, there is no way to protect the participants and the workshops, speak directly to the individual(s). Help them design a path forward where their skillset is valid and useful. The workshop can’t stop, but I don’t want your job to stop either.
Do take it personally. Possibly the hardest of all personas, you have a morally sound ground to act on every other persona with the exception of this.","The context. You’ve been called in to run a workshop to assist in process and product improvement. The workshop result will most likely be a reduction in hours or labor needs. Meaning… it could take away jobs. Specifically, jobs of the participant(s). Everyone in the room is afraid that if they build something useful, it may render them “obsolete.”",,
Oversharer,Easy,,https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732452/lectures/39188793,"At the outset of the session, let the group know you will be a stickler for time. Not to be annoying, but to get through the meeting on time or early!
Establish a time limit for sharing from the beginning. “During this section, each person will have X
[a predetermined amount of time] to share their ideas in order to give everyone else the same opportunity to share.” Now you need to stick to it!
Make it audible! If you’ve established a time, bring your favorite horn or download the air horn app. Consider this auditory cue for exciting and informing the group.
Have a phone or access to Youtube? Start a timer and put it on the projector where all can see it. If they are speaking on a mutually interesting point, pause the timer and allow them to finish, assuming their discussion is aligned with your agenda and/or outcomes.","Could be nerves -- could just be a talker. Regardless, they are eating up valuable meeting time and draining everyone’s focus. Don’t let them ZAP all the energy from the room!",,"And tuna mahi mahi.
Don't take it. Persona. Mmm. Hear an echo?
Don't take it personally. Don't take it personally. Welcome.
In the next few minutes, I'm gonna read off this card. I'm gonna find a Persona that we commonly run into in workshops. I'm gonna describe it. John's gonna come up with methods for managing them, and then I'm going to tell him why my methods are better than his. You ready?
I'm ready.
Okay. So this Persona, this individual, tends to talk a lot. Cut from my own cloth tends to talk a lot. They kind of, once they have an idea, maybe they have a lot of ideas, but they're going. They're going to continuously share, share, share, share until everyone's drowning in their words and it kind of prevents everyone else from getting anything meaningful.
Overshare.
Yeah, I think I was oversharing the oversharer. So, yeah. John, how do you manage an oversharer?
There's a lot of things that you can do. Again, proactive approach is, in my opinion, the best you can. Time box. An oversharer.
Put them in a box.
Hey, look, we're only going to take 15 seconds to capture what each person has to say. Super brief, et cetera, et cetera. It doesn't have to be 15 seconds. You give everybody the same amount of time and then you have some kind of alarm clock or something that is not you, potentially, to interrupt them.
Air horn right in their ear. Right in their deep eardrum canal. Yeah, don't do that.

And what you do is you cut them off. You lay down the rule, and if they break the rule, you cut it off. Now, you have to be super consistent with this, because if you let somebody else go who's potentially not an oversharer and it gets to that person and you haven't cut people off, you're going to have a hard time playing favorites here.
Yeah, very true. Keep the same pattern to everyone, even though everyone kind of needs to be treated slightly differently. Time boxing is the best way, I've found, to deal with oversharers. If you have to, you can cut them off. It can come across as rude if you haven't done the, set the rules beforehand and then corrected them. If this is the first time they're being corrected, it might just be kind of offensive. Another thing is give them the assignment of writing down everything they think as opposed to saying it right. Do more with your hand than with your mouth. They can also write down questions. They can be your note taker. You give them a role where they're constantly doing something so that it makes it slightly more difficult to overshare all the time that is on top of time boxing.
Yes. Going along that thread that you have, getting them to capture what they are saying or reflect on other people and how you can potentially draw that out of other people that aren't sharing a lot. Like, let's shift roles. If you're standing, sit. If you're sitting, stand. If you've shared a lot, let's listen and ask questions. If you've been listening and asking questions, let's speak more, you know, et cetera, et cetera, and try to reverse those rules a little bit. Potentially bring that person out of that shell and potentially into another one being.
Intentional about who is going to be able to talk. So, you know, we're about to share you. You are going to share. You know, they haven't talked that much. The overshare is over here. And you could call on them, but you're calling on someone new, and that kind of takes the overshare off the table as well.
Yes. And to that point, saying, we want to hear from somebody that has not been talking a lot. So it's a finesse way of saying, you've been talking way too much. Let's be quiet and give somebody else a shot.
Yeah, I'm a fan of. We're gonna call on someone who hasn't been talking that much, making eye contact with them. You gotta turn your head at a certain. I think it's a 47 degree angle.
Yes.
In order to not be offensive and be playful, but you can put that in. So they get a little bit of self awareness. Dead giveaways. That they're an overshare is as soon as they stand up to start talking, everybody does this little number right here and looks down. They're trying to

get comfortable, and then they're trying to get their mindset blank. Cause they're not gonna listen to anything they're gonna say. Cause they already know it's gonna be a long talk.
Yes. I had something and I lost it. It's gonna come back to me. An overshare.
I was hopeful. I was hopeful.
I was too. I was too.
So we know those are the dead giveaways. Do you have any story of an overshare and how you dealt with them?
Yes. So one thing we've talked about the time boxing, but being able to use music has helped me in a scenario like that that I could not find a way around. I attempted to be proactive. It didn't really help. I attempted to call on people that hadn't already spoken, and what ends up happening for those, sometimes that person will jump in and go, well, that doesn't always happen. Or, oh, yeah, you're right. Like that time that we. And it's like, you're not talking. We're listening to them right now. When that doesn't work, I've tried audio. You play music and you go, listen. I need everybody's help here. When I hit play, no talking. I won't be talking. I don't want anybody in here to be talking. I want you to listen to the music. It's Enya, and it's epically delicious for your eardrums. So if you hear somebody asking for a pen or doing something with their mouth where noise comes out, I'd like for you to tell on them. And I try to be funny about it, et cetera. And people are like, shushing other people that are like, oh, excuse me. And you're like, shitty. You get everybody to be quiet. That prevents the oversharer from talking without ostracizing themselves.
Yeah, to be frank, although, well, I'm Johnny, but to be frank, to be frank, to whoever he is or she, here's the point I'm gonna make. You stole it from me.
You stole it right back.
It was a good point.
So it happens to everybody.
Okay. It does. It does. Is there anything else you'd like to mention about oversharers? What else?
Sometimes you need to escalate what you're asking them to do in the audience and going on a break and going up to somebody and actually telling them how they're coming across

to the group is very awkward to do. It's hard to do, but if you can manage it, sometimes you are conveying a message to them that their coworkers and colleagues haven't been able to muster up the courage to do. And you're doing them a favor in the long run by saying, look, when you talk, you have a lot of really good points. If they do, if they don't have any good points, then don't lie to them.
So you have a lot of points. You have a lot of points.
Yeah, leave that piece out. And you say, this is what I'm noticing when you talk. I'm looking around the room, and at least 70% of everybody is rolling their eyes because you're about to stalk, because they know you're going to go on.
And on and on.
And I want to get the most out of you in this moment with these people doing this thing. I'd like for you. Why don't we come back from this break. If you can try to take on a different role of talking. I don't want this to be a slap on the wrist. I don't want you to shut down. They might shut down if you don't do this appropriately.
Yeah, that's a tough one.
But I have always been a firm believer in the sacrifice of one for the betterment of many is a good play as a facilitator. If you're going to ruin the experience of 25 people because one person shuts down, sometimes your role as a facilitator shut them down.
The best tips you can get are probably from kindergarten and first grade teachers. Although we are with adults, they act exactly like children. And sometimes our role, especially with managing overshares, is to use some of the tactics that a teacher would use to help a kid stay focused and stay in line. Overshares time box them. Slap on some music for no talking time. Cut them off if you need to. Give them support so that they can condense down their ideas better. Don't take it personally."
