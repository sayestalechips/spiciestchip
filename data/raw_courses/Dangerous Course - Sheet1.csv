Course overview,https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/dangerous-the-fast-track-to-facilitation/lectures/39101441,"Okay. Hey. So people are about to take their time, and they're going to watch some of this, all of this, hopefully. Why would they want to watch it? What are they going to get out of it? How does it benefit them? Et cetera? All the above.

So, two pieces. This course is about getting you from zero to dangerous, meaning, teach you the basic tools and tactics you need to become not just a better problem solver and decision maker for yourself, but to lead others through that in kind of a collaborative setting that you might call meetings, we call workshops to get you a bit further, faster. Now, what does that entail to get zero to dangerous? We're going to walk you through first. What is a workshop? What are the tools that we use to become better decision makers? How do you set up this space, which you can see behind us? What materials do you need? What game day tactics like when you're in the workshop? What do you need to know in order to manage better people and make more effective decisions? And lastly, how do you execute on what you learned during that meeting, that session, and turn it into reality? Take that intangible workshop and turn it into action. All of that's going to be wrapped up into a pretty little package that hopefully only takes your morning plus part of your afternoon, so that you end up being a funk master. Meeting Flex, is that a thing? Just like John. That's his official Instagram funk master.

Follow me here.

All right.
",
Introduction,https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/dangerous-the-fast-track-to-facilitation/lectures/39101704,"Your meetings suck, and you're not unique. All right, all right, John, relax. I came in a little hot there and maybe a little salesy, but let me explain. Meetings are the enemy, right? Here's why. Managers are spending 50% of their day in meetings. Average employee, up to 6 hours a day. That's like 60 hours whenever. It's so many days. I'm bad at math. I'm not gonna lie. I'm bad at math. So what we wanna do in this next few hours of your life is teach you how to have better courses, better courses, better meetings, and tackle it. The common problems which. John, we're gonna look up there and read the.

Yeah, there's a ton of them. I say we'll riff off of a couple of the reasons why meetings suck, and then we'll look back there. So why do meetings suck?

Because it could have been an email.

Yeah. The person in charge just takes control of the whole thing. Nobody gets a chance to say anything.

Everybody's just like right here on their cell phone, texting their, I don't know, Tinder. I don't know.

Swiping. Yeah, swiping. Yeah. Nobody is paying attention. Whether it's that or they're doing their own thing or they're off in La la Land, nobody's paying attention.

Here's the one I don't like. Meetings that lead to more meetings that.

Go to other meetings or the pre meeting to prepare for the meetings meeting so that everybody's on board for you to say whatever you need to say in that meeting.

So overall, summarize it. You're wasting time because the meetings aren't effective, because you're not really using a guide to get you to an end result. And in order to do that, we've created this simple course.

Yes.

What else?

Well, I think the purpose and reason of this is to take somebody that has no idea what they need to do, what's coming their way, and just have the wherewithal to actually zero in on their own unique isms as they go to understand their personality, how it relates to what they want to get out of a meeting or an event or I. Some kind of workshop, et cetera.

And why are you qualified to teach this course? Credibility.

Ah, there we go. Yeah. Well, most people that do what you and I do have done about 150 to 170 workshops, like all day workshops in a matter of about ten years. And you and I have both done independently, more than 500 each. And so our combined knowledge on what works, what doesn't work, why it works, why it doesn't work are ways that we can teach you so that it doesn't happen to you when it goes horribly wrong. And we live with this terribly awkward moment of why it didn't work. Everyone's looking at you strange. You don't get what you want out of the meeting or event. And we kind of know how to circumvent those things and we're going to help you do it the same for yourself.

Yeah, agreed. So over the past five years, I think we can both agree we've had an unhealthy obsession with making meetings. Not just matter, but turn them into a thing we call workshops. We've done it with some of the largest companies in the world, whether that's IBM or Iberia. Most of mine were in Europe. I am american, obviously. John headed up the Navy, created programs for the Navy, was flying all over the country doing amazing stuff. So super credible guy, very tall guy compared to me. I'm going to mention that a lot. I think have little man syndrome. And I think that's what they need to know about us, that we've run a lot of these. We want you to learn from our mistakes. And hopefully, unlike this introduction, the course will be concise and exactly what you need to have effective and productive meetings.

Yeah, and we don't exactly know how to end this, but I will say that we don't like to talk about ourselves and that credibility piece. If you're looking for what certifications you have in this, that or the other, we're not going to list them out. There's a ton. There's a lot of stuff. We've been all over the place. We have witnessed other courses in action. We've provided feedback for these other courses in action. And this is not about getting a certificate to prove that you are capable of doing X, Y and Z. This is your own journey. You take it, however incremental, approach that you need to take it to become effective at what you do. And that's why we're here.

Cool scene. High five.

Lateral Thinking Kickstart,https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/dangerous-the-fast-track-to-facilitation/lectures/39101725,This is a lateral thinking exercise to inspire your participants to think in a new way. It can help gain credibility and confidence from the group.,
"Seriously, what's a workshop?",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/dangerous-the-fast-track-to-facilitation/lectures/39118644,"This is the story of a girl. What's, what's a workshop? Johnny? John.
What'S a workshop?
So we've mentioned the word a lot already. You probably didn't know what we were talking about, so it's good that we're dealing with it right off the bat. So I'm gonna lay out the most basic definition I can give and then maybe we break it down. So a workshop is a time boxed series of activities or exercises that are intentionally selected so that you can guide a group through conversations.
That was really good. That was really good. Really good.
The reason we do that, when we talk about the differences between a workshop and a meeting, because we're attacking meetings so often. The difference to me is meetings are, meetings are human, so meetings get easily distracted. Meetings start late, meetings don't really go to plan. They may have an agenda, but it's very passive. The whole meeting process is passive, passive, conversational. A workshop is much more directional, intentional. So everything is laid out so that we can get from one point to a final, predetermined, most of the time predetermines destiny or destination.
Outcome.
Outcome, that's a better word, outcome. So that we actually make progress and we can confidently guarantee progress before we even arrive at the table or at the virtual table.
I love it. So I think maybe to give some examples of what those are, let's just kind of go through what can you workshop, what can we, let's just start throwing some stuff out. What have you done? We'll just go back and forth. I'd say team building a group of people that don't maybe necessarily get along right.
And the more basic we can go problem solving, problem finding, brainstorming are like the most common areas, but let's make it more practical. Like you were team building, marketing strategy, overall company business strategy. So back to you.
Recruitment, onboarding, making an app for something.
Retaining talent would play into that. Hr you were looking at, even the concept for what you are going to market, the overall concepts behind it, the creativity behind it, can be workshops. You could workshop your life. Stanford does that with the class life design. You can workshop designing your life, designing your life. Thank you correcting me. You could workshop or I really think you can workshop almost anything.
Anything.
Which is the problem. Which is the problem sometimes.
And the thing with that is it's just one of those things where you hear often, if you do everything for everybody, you do nothing for nobody type of thing. In this case, anything that involves human beings gathering around to discuss where they are kind of where they need to be and kind of the connection to get there, and the smart metrics that allow you to kind of cut the red tape to arrive. There is something that you can workshop. You can workshop the efficiency and effectiveness of the team while they're together and get the tacit knowledge out of that group towards that common outcome. So really, you can workshop just about anything.
Very true. And we don't want you to try and workshop everything at once. We do want you to start small and tackle the more simple pieces before you expand to changing your entire organizational culture. With workshops, we want to make sure that you know how to do the basics of solving a problem, or finding a problem, or just getting people in a room and having a guided conversation where not everyone's just yelling at each other, speaking over each other, but equal opportunity to speak, share and learn. And that's a workshop.","""Seriously, what's a workshop?"" | https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/dangerous-the-fast-track-to-facilitation/lectures/39118644

Definition of a workshop:

Workshop atmosphere:

Should be different from a typical meeting
Encourage active participation and engagement
Create a space where all voices can be heard


Starting small:

Begin with shorter, simpler workshops to build confidence and skills
Gradually increase complexity and duration as you gain experience



By understanding and applying these concepts, you'll be well-equipped to facilitate effective workshops that drive meaningful results and engagement from participants."
Design Thinking,https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/dangerous-the-fast-track-to-facilitation/lectures/39118707,"So when people talk about workshops about design, right, there's a million different ways to talk about it. But a lot of people say human centered design and design thinking, and they use them interchangeably. So what is human centered design?

And they tie them all into workshops. It gets chaos when you get on the line and start looking this stuff up. So when you think about human centered design, it's a simple concept. Focus on the people having the problems and try and solve their problems with them. And for them, that's about all you need to know. And then when you start thinking about design thinking, how does that tie in?

So design thinking is kind of a means of accomplishing that thing, a means of getting at the human element and truly understanding and empathizing with the user, with the designers, with everybody along that process. Design thinking is that tool to be able to uncover that.

Exactly. And when I think of it, because I make everything into a story or analogy, I think of a game of darts. Design thinking is like a game of darts. So without design thinking, this is how your dart game would go. You get three darts, you throw them at a board, and you hit Jeff, who's sitting next to the board, on accident, and then you have to go to the hospital, and it ruins your night. Now, with design thinking, you're given more darts. You're allowed to stand closer to the board, and you have a bigger bullseye. Here's why. When you use design thinking, I thought.

You were going to say you hit more people.

You hit more people. Well, sometimes you hit people. Yeah, you got to throw a few darts at people to make a good product. No, but you get to know your user better, so you understand your target better. Then you run a lot of tests, which is prototyping, that's throwing more darts. And then finally, the bullseye is bigger, because when you understand the people involved and their problem, you're more likely to actually hit the bullseye. And so that's why I use that as an example, and that's design thinking, human centered design. And that's how we tie it into the process of workshops. So, focusing in on people and their problems and then collaborating to solve them together.

Alarm Clock,https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/dangerous-the-fast-track-to-facilitation/lectures/39118726,"So we just talked about human centered design, design thinking. Now, let's put it into maybe a more practical scenario. Some people learn by doing. So John's going to be our person, our participant, and I'm going to walk him through a simple exercise to highlight the difference.

I'm going to be.

He's going to be Vanna. He's going to be Vanna. And we're going to try not to drop stuff while we're doing this. Here we go. So, John, all I'd like you to do, 30 seconds. You as well, viewer out there, I'd like you to draw an alarm clock. Draw an alarm clock. Ready? Go. Now, you don't have to be Michelangelo. This isn't about high quality, incredible drawing. This is about drawing an alarm clock, simply put. So you've got about 10 seconds, because I count very quickly an alarm clock. So we'll see what John's drawing, okay? And we'll call it time. So, John, what did you draw? Can you show the. Oh, yeah, the viewers?

I drew a Google mini.

A Google mini?

Yep.

Because that's his alarm clock.

I know for sure that I will wake up unless the power goes out with a Google mini.

Perfect. So maybe you users out there drew an old school alarm clock like the one here that just popped up on the screen right here. We hope, hopefully. And maybe I look psychic, because I knew that the reason why you drew such a concrete thing is because I gave you a noun. I gave you the solution. When I say draw an alarm clock, I'm already giving you the answer, so I'm putting you in a box. So when we start thinking about humans and their needs, each human has a specific need. So I'm going to flip it open. Instead of nouns, we're going to focus on verbs. So now, instead of drawing an alarm clock, what I'd like you to do, we're going to, again, put it in as a verb. I like you to draw the perfect experience.

Okay.

Draw the perfect way to wake up in the morning is how it would be.

Can I write on this?

Yeah, go ahead.

All right.

Again, 30 seconds to a minute. It is usually all people need you. Again, don't be Michelangelo. Your perfect way. Any resources, any place in the world, anytime, present, past, future. What would be your perfect way to wake up in the morning? So we'll give John just a couple more seconds. Again, notice the difference in the number of ideas generated and the concepts generated, how different they are, how focused they are on each individual when it is a verb as opposed to a noun. So, throughout your workshops, throughout your experience running these sessions, remember, verbs generate and nouns are concrete. They lock you in. So, John, what was your experience? What's the perfect way to wake up in the morning in John Holly's world?

Yeah. So, breakfast is ready to roll. Those are apple pancakes. My daughter is coming to wake me up just at the right time, where the light is actually entering the room, not earlier, and potentially some music or something playing somewhere.

Preference on tunes. Preference.

Elevator music for the morning. Type of. Type of thing where, like, you know, like the soundtrack to Axel folly or something like that.

Potentially wonderful. Wonderful. So I crushed that, by the way. You crushed it. Beautiful drawing. To wrap this all up with a nice, pretty bowden. When we focus on humans and their particular needs, even though the noun might be similar, the experience is vastly different. So when you are running these workshops, you need to understand the people in the room and understand their experiences are vastly different. The goal is to combine those into an incredible result. So collaborate effectively, make decisions better, find the right problems, and solve them. And that's what the alarm clock exercise is all about.

I thought you were gonna say, check out the hook while my dj revolves it.

Dance. This is my dance move.

Oh, God, don't do that again.

Purpose of the exercise:

Demonstrate the difference between solution-focused and problem-focused thinking
Highlight the importance of human-centered design and design thinking


First part of the exercise:

Ask participants to draw an alarm clock in 30 seconds
This represents a solution-focused approach
Limits creativity by providing a specific solution (alarm clock)


Second part of the exercise:

Ask participants to draw ""the perfect way to wake up in the morning""
This represents a problem-focused, human-centered approach
Encourages more diverse and creative solutions


Key differences in results:

Alarm clock task typically results in similar, conventional designs
Perfect wake-up task leads to varied, personalized solutions


Lessons from the exercise:

Focusing on verbs (actions) generates more ideas than focusing on nouns (objects)
Human-centered design considers individual needs and experiences
Open-ended questions lead to more innovative solutions


Application to workshops:

Frame questions and tasks in terms of experiences or actions, not specific solutions
Encourage participants to think beyond conventional answers
Recognize that different people may have vastly different needs and preferences


Facilitation tips:

Give clear, timed instructions for each part of the exercise
Encourage participants to share their ideas after each round
Highlight the diversity of solutions in the second round


Design thinking principles illustrated:

Empathize with users and their unique needs
Define the problem in human-centric terms
Ideate a wide range of possible solutions
Prototype and test ideas based on user feedback


Workshop application:

Use this exercise as an icebreaker or introduction to design thinking concepts
Apply the lesson to subsequent workshop activities by framing challenges in open-ended ways
Encourage participants to consider diverse perspectives throughout the workshop


Facilitation insights:

Be prepared for unexpected responses
Use the exercise to demonstrate how framing affects problem-solving
Emphasize that there are no ""wrong"" answers in the open-ended version


Follow-up discussion points:

How did participants feel during each part of the exercise?
What surprised them about the difference in results?
How can this approach be applied to their work or specific challenges?



By understanding and using this exercise, you'll be able to effectively introduce design thinking concepts, encourage creative problem-solving, and demonstrate the value of human-centered approaches in your workshops. This tool sets the stage for more innovative and user-focused solutions throughout your facilitation process."
Material World,https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/dangerous-the-fast-track-to-facilitation/lectures/39118756,"All right, so you find yourself preparing for a workshop, an event, a meeting, and you need to get yourself prepared and ready. Oh, thanks. So let's dive in. What are some things that we should have on hand at the ready? Right.

Basic toolkit for a workshop. What do you need in order to help all these gooses lay their eggs, as they say?

Can we start with this?

Oh, yeah. Daniel Larusso, aka karate kid. For those of you who have no life and haven't seen that movie, a name tag. A name tag is a great simple way to make sure one you remember everyone's name, because when you say their name, they respond to you, but they also feel closer to you, so they're more open to share. If you're just saying, hey, person, share your most intimate feelings, usually you don't get good results.

So name tags and people generally can't remember names? Well, most people can. I can't very well unless I'm getting paid to, and then I cheat and write them all down. I'm like, very, very tall person is frank, et cetera, et cetera.

I find it best to just grab another tool that we have, a sharpie and write it right across their forehead. No, but while we're on the theme or the piece of sharpies, John, why do we use a sharpie as opposed to any other writing utensil for workshops?

You could use a pen, and we will talk about this tool here in a minute. But if you did use a pen, you could probably write a couple paragraphs on this. But if you have a Sharpie. Right. You can take up a lot more space, which allows you to be more succinct in your ideas, thoughts, execution, etcetera. If you really want to get crazy about it, you give them a huge one, which will limit how much they can put on any given sticky. Which leads us to stickies.

Stickies. Why do we use stickies? The reasoning behind stickies is kind of a build on to what John said. So the sticky limits the amount of thinking you can do per thought. Because, man, there's limitless stickies. So you can have as many thoughts as you want, but you have to be succinct because there's a controlled amount of space.

And also, there's only 70.

70. Okay, so there's limitless. Limitless to 70. But let me. Let me continue. But you can have as many as you want if you buy multiple. That's true. It lets you keep your ideas short, share as many ideas as possible, and it encourages everyone to share because you don't have to say it out loud. It makes it easier for people to share.

And when people are sharing and there are a lot of ideas, sometimes you need to be able to vote on the ones that most people agree with so that you understand where are we on the same page? And where are we not on the same page. Sometimes those discussions take place by a simple vote. There are a million ways to do this. We could talk about this forever, but simply keeping it anonymous is a really good way of doing that. Or having everybody place the vote at the same time. This basically just says that even though he's the boss and I work for the boss, our votes count equally. And so it's an equal voice type of thing, and it doesn't allow any one person to take control of the entire thing.

So we've got dots, we've got post its, we've got sharpies. So we have a place to write and a thing to vote on them, but we need a place to put them. So that's when this is pretty handy. These are giant, essentially giant post it notes. They're sticky at the top. Post its don't stick very good to the top. That's a pro tip. What you do need to know, you can have this, you can have whiteboard, just some surface, even if it's a wall, that people will write their post its on the table and then put them on a wall. So there's a common area where everyone can see them. So in one view, you can see and remember everyone's opinions. That's a really great advantage, for sure.

And not to mention when you want to leave for the day, instead of cleaning up the whole room, you can take those off, fold them, label them, and then you can go and revisit exactly what that was like at that point in time. But if you don't have any of those things, this will allow you to kind of pick and parse different areas of a wall to put different things in. Categories, groups of things, modules. You can kind of divide the wall into various things with tape. And there are other ways that you can use this.

And it's a particular type of tape. It's painters tape. So you don't destroy people's walls, homes, offices, and just look really bad because you've left a mark on their precious.

My precious.

Yes, exactly. Exactly. So use this, this kind of painters tape, trying to keep us on time. Have a clock of some kind. Could be your phone. It could be a time timer that's really popular. It could be your watch or your fitbit. If you're trying to get your 10,000 steps in a day, just put it on your cat, have something put it on your cat, have something to track time that's visual for other people as well so that they can stay on track and not feel rushed or not panic because they know they're doing what they're supposed to. And I think that's all the materials you need to really rock a workshop. Now there are other things like fidget toys, fidget spinners, other things for warmups, other ways to continuously engage people. But this is dangerous. This is zero to dangerous. So with these tools, basic tools you have in front of us, I think.

We have in front of us. Oh, unless you have those in front of us.

Yeah. So the ones you see in front of you on screen that are in front of us, then you'll be good to go to crush a workshop. Boom. Together. Boom.

Rules are Cool,https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/dangerous-the-fast-track-to-facilitation/lectures/39118743,"You want me to start?

No, I can do it.

Okay.

All right. So your meeting is starting, but you need some kind of structure, some kind of guidelines for everyone so that they play fairly. I like to do this at the beginning and we'll go, we'll banter back and forth after. But we're going to go through some basic rules for your workshops so that they are as effective as possible. Where can we find those rules?

They're right here.

Okay. They're here.

We cheated. They're right here.

And it's not that many. It's not that many.

Right. A visual for you to see. Getting everybody on the same page in the very beginning before you start. It pays dividends as opposed to cutting people off somewhere along the lines that broke a rule that you never told them existed in the first place.

Correct.

So being proactive in this case is significantly better than being reactive. So we're going to go through those. So I'll start us off. No phones or laptops. So we want to basically take the distractions away from ourselves so that we can become engaged in each other in that active listening component and we can riff off of each other as we go.

Next one. Pick it up and put it back down where I took it from. Draw it out. Draw everything you can. It engages a different part of your brain than writing. And by doing that, it helps you be a little bit more creative. So draw your ideas, even if you're not Michael Angelo.

And based on what you just said, you said, write it out as part of what you said. We're drawing. Write everything out because in the moment, everybody is there. You're excited. You remember what you talked about, but you might not next Tuesday or next month or next year. And if you don't have something concrete to go back to, this is what we talked about, this is what we discussed. This is who's going to do what and by when. If you don't write those things out, everyone's left kind of scratching their head. Where do we go from here?

Love it. Next, one opportunity to collaborate. What we mean by that is open to sharing, open to hearing others opinions, not biting one another's heads off. No, Judge Judy's in the room.

Although it's a great show.

It's a great show. But what I mean by that is don't judge each other. Maybe judge your ideas every now and then for good feedback. But don't just lay down the. Lay down the guillotine. That's not a saying, but don't do that. Don't do that.

Okay. And you want to make sure that everybody is excited and working towards that common goal together and taking the appropriate amount of breaks. So a rule would be like, let's have fun. Let's dive into this and become invested in what we're working towards together, ourselves, et cetera, and act out what we need to do. And I actually don't know what action action means. The way that you wrote that, and I was trying to rip off of what I thought of.

Man, that was good.

I think we should keep rolling here. What did that one mean?

Everything we do here is about actually moving and making progress, even if it's physical. So people will tend to want to sit down and not be involved. This is all about action. So we need everyone involved in moving around. If they're not moving, they're not sharing. That's the great thing about post its evidence. And the last rule, which there's usually an image of a giraffe hugging a tree. The reason why, just imagine that a giraffe hugging a tree and smiling. Because giraffes smile, is that this isn't a meeting, this is a workshop. It's going to be uncomfortable. It's going to be different than what we're used to, and we need to be comfortable being uncomfortable.

Boom.

And that's how we get progress.

Sweet. So one thing that we want to talk about briefly, instead of making this video super long, we'll just talk super quick about different styles that we have that are not the same as one another. So Johnny likes to take all of these things and kind of lay out the rules of engagement, so to speak, before we jump into a workshop or an event to lay that foundation. I choose to dive right in right away and bring up onesie twosie things along the way. I like to get a feel of who's in the room and who's going to interrupt me. And I position myself physically in the room so that I can be proactive at certain stakes and sometimes be reactive. So maybe you could give a couple reasons for yours, I'll give a couple for mine, and then we'll go from there. Yeah.

I found these kind of, I don't know, lanes like bowling, though, with the gutters.

Yep.

So these are the inflatable things that they put in the gutters.

Bumpers.

Bumpers. So that you can't just throw all gutter balls. This kind of guarantees that everyone has a common understanding of how they're supposed to interact and an expectation for we're gonna be uncomfortable. This is different. I normally don't have rules when I show up to a conference table. On top of that, there are other rules that you could add in, like only one person talk at a time. That's a simple rule that you can repeat a lot and then people will start saying it to each other and kind of helping you facilitate and be better at it. But I like to do it at the beginning just because everybody's on the same page. I can always reference it like, hey, you remember that giraffe in the tree? Are you being the giraffe right now or are you being an elephant in the mud? I don't know. This is an analogy.

Yeah, that's a good one. So one of the reasons that I like to do it in the moment is because sometimes there's a bad apple somewhere in your group, and for me to find out who that is right away and have everybody around me see and experience exactly what I'm experiencing and see the. Yep, there he goes again, doing it again. He's doing it again. He's taking control of this, he's taking control of that. Or she's doing this or that. I can see it, I can witness it, and I can stop it in its tracks in front of everybody else and flip the script. So now it's not just about that person. We're going to stop, make somewhat of an example. It could be funny, it could be stern. I have a very strong personality, so I will lean into that situation so that it kind of takes care of that rule by an example. And not everybody likes to do that. Sometimes it can go terribly wrong. I like to do it. It keeps me on my toes and it keeps everybody on the same page. Nobody here is more important than anybody else, including the facilitator. If you're talking, I'm listening. If I'm talking, you're listening. It's not because of the position that we hold. We want to respect everybody in the room. We want to work towards that common goal together. The rules are a very good way of doing it. We've seen people in the very beginning ask, what's the worst meeting, what's the worst event you've been part of? What are we not going to do today? And everybody kind of throws in, into the ring, hey, I don't want to do this, we're not going to do this, we're not going to do that. And you compile this list and it almost becomes your covenant of things that we're not going to do together. So that when it does happen, everybody can go. Uh uh. You remember we said we weren't going to do that. And to Johnny's point, you have people in the room that are facilitating for you in that moment because you can't be everywhere at once. So, you know, you might have different rules that you want to live by. It. It really is dependent on what you're trying to accomplish, who's in the room, and what your personality is to be able to do it. Those are just a couple ways of looking at it.

Right. And try and keep them limited because this is already a lot to digest. So keep them as simple as possible so that you are able to repeat them and maybe expand upon them during the workshop. But regardless, people will remember them. So rules for rulers. I need to quit pointing at the camera.

","Rules are Cool | https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/dangerous-the-fast-track-to-facilitation/lectures/39118743

Encourages participants to embrace new experiences and methods


Presentation of rules:

Consider using visual aids or posters to display rules
Make rules visible throughout the workshop for easy reference


Flexibility in rule application:

Adapt rules to fit the specific group and workshop goals
Be prepared to add or modify rules as needed


Enforcement of rules:

Consistently apply rules to all participants
Address rule violations promptly and respectfully


Different approaches to introducing rules:

Some facilitators prefer to introduce all rules at the beginning
Others introduce rules as needed throughout the workshop


Benefits of clear rules:

Creates a level playing field for all participants
Helps manage group dynamics
Provides a framework for productive discussions


Facilitator's role in rule-setting:

Explain the purpose behind each rule
Model adherence to the rules
Be prepared to remind participants of rules as needed


Customizing rules:

Consider the specific needs of your group and workshop objectives
Allow for participant input on additional rules if appropriate


Follow-up on rules:

Refer back to rules during the workshop when necessary
Use rules as a tool to refocus the group if discussions go off-track



By implementing and effectively communicating these rules, you create a structured yet creative environment for your workshop. This approach helps ensure that all participants are on the same page and can contribute effectively towards the workshop's goals. Remember, the key is to present these rules as enablers of productivity and creativity, not as restrictive measures."
Warm Ups,https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/dangerous-the-fast-track-to-facilitation/lectures/39118769,"The Romans, they counted numbers with thanks. In this exercise, all you need is honestly some paper to display to your participants what you're going to ask of them, what you're going to challenge them to do. You can do it with unlimited numbers of people. All you need to do is the following and it's good if they have stuff to write on because they're going to want to try and figure it out. It's a bit of a riddle. So on here, I'm going to count in this, I think, roman numeral nine. Here's the challenge. We're going to try and turn this roman numeral nine, wait for it, beautiful, into roman numeral six. Roman numeral six. Now, I'm always terrible at counting in roman numerals because I'm not from Rome. Obviously, you can tell by my outfit. So we're going to try and turn a nine into a six. And here is the challenging part. You can only do it with one line, one continuous line. It can be straight, squiggly, it can be round, but one line with one single line. You have to turn this nine, this nine into a six. I'm going to give you 1 minute to try and figure it out and I'm going to stay here, stare uncomfortably while you try it yourself. Alright? So if you actually thought I was going to stay for a minute, just hit pause, that would be incredibly ridiculous. And we're not going to fast forward with me just like, hey, look at that. So here is how you do it. Most people, they see it and they say, well, I could just cut it in half and now I've got a six there. No sir, no ma'am, mm mm. Not at my table. That is not what we're looking for. The problem is we get so locked in with what we're looking at again, we can't see the forest through the trees. When we take a step back and think a bit more laterally, a bit different, we notice these are already letters, right? Ix is already a letter. Let me get a fresh page so you can get a fresh view. So with the ix, all we're trying to do is draw a six with a continuous line. My people, context. Context is everything. So in this warmup, which forces you to think differently, we realize context to the problem is what's going to help us solve it. If we're too close to it, if we're not understanding what the root of the problem is and being willing to think outside the box, we're never going to find the solution, even if it's as simple as drawing a single letter. And that, my friends, is roman numbers.

","Warm Ups | https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/dangerous-the-fast-track-to-facilitation/lectures/39118769

Purpose of the exercise:

Encourage lateral thinking

Discovery Dive,https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/dangerous-the-fast-track-to-facilitation/lectures/39118875,"So in this module, we're going to walk you through the three basic things that I say basic a lot. We're going to cut this out.

Just keep going. Just keep going.

Okay, we're going to walk you through the three areas that you need to know of a workshop. The first being discovery, learning what you need to know in order to set it up. The next being the venue, the physical space where you'll have the workshop, and the final one being the agenda. What are you actually going to do in the workshop? In this particular section, we're talking discovery now for Discovery, we've made it so easy that you don't even have to think yourself. John, show them what we've created. What do we have to offer today?

Yeah, so it's a discovery template. When you flip through it, it'll tell you about the template itself. It'll tell you how to use it, when to use it, and then it basically just has these questions that you can go one by one. If you've ever called someone and you were so nervous that you planned out the phone call before it actually took place, and you're like, well, what if she says this? Or what if he says that? And you kind of have that roadmap in your brain or on paper, ready to go. That's kind of what your template should be. It should not be something that somebody hands to you and you look at for the very first time while you're making a phone call. It can be something that you take, make your own, put it in the language that you speak so that when you do ask questions, you are attentive to the way that you ask those questions, and you can really dive in deep with that discovery. So I think maybe we do a little bit of a role play thing.

Let's do a role play. You'll have those questions. You can lean on them if you need to, expand on them however you like, but let's do a role play. So I'm going to get into character much better. So I'm boss Hog. Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop. This is a phone.

Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring. Hello?

Hey, is this John old Hollye? This is Boss Hogg.

Yes, it is. How are you?

I'm doing okay, Jonald. Listen, my friend Peter. You know Peter, CEO of the company that has dog jackets.

I know. Yes, I have one of them.

Okay, great, great. Just ugly jackets beside the point. So, listen, my team, they're screwing up. They're screwing up all the time. We've tried to bring people in, and we've tried to boss them. We've created a calendar of everything they need to know, but they're just not getting their work done. I don't understand what's going on. I'm supposed to be the leader and I'm lost. So I need someone to come in and get these people back to where they need to be. I don't know what's happening. Peter said you could help.

Sure, yeah. I'm going to put you on speakerphone, mainly because I don't want to keep doing this.

That's a good idea.

You're on speakerphone now, so, yeah. If you don't mind, maybe I can ask you a couple questions to figure out the what, why, how behind what you're looking at, where you are attempting to go, and kind of outcome that you're looking to have when you do solve this and figure out kind of what's wrong and how you can solve it.

Yeah, that makes sense. That makes sense. Let's hear it. What you got? Awesome.

And are you thinking about getting a group of people together and solving this, or are you looking at core group, big group? How are you going to try to do that?

So Peter said you were the man with the magic hat, so we're going to follow your best recommendation. There are a few people that seem like they don't play well together at all. In fact, we just moved them to different offices so that they don't even run into each other at all. So if you think you can handle that, it's a lot to corral.

Okay. Okay. So, to me, it seems like you need to get people together to find out what they think. Right? You said that you like to kind of get in there and move things around, but maybe we need to find out what they think. So, you know, what kind of departments can we bring in together that are all part of this problem, potentially, and maybe even ones that are departments that we could emulate. So I think the more the merrier if you could bring something like that in. Do you have any ideas of where this started, where this came from?

I like to be a hands on leader, but I kind of was away for a bit on vacation and trying to do life. But what I've heard with my ear to the ground is that it started somehow between sales and HR, and it was just a personal problem, and it has nothing to do with the departments they were working in. And now they've just ballooned into this massive cultural problem we're having between everyone at the company. It's a culture war and people are picking sides.

Okay. Okay. So I'm gonna throw some things out to you. And I work this a little bit differently to find out kind of, if you are in the ballgame to do this. But my thought would be to have a workshop. Are you up to let people come away for one day to solve this? Two days? What is your bandwidth to be able to do this with your people?

Yeah, we have some time to be able. A half a day. We definitely can. So can a workshop. Is that like powwow? Because we've had training seminars and nothing comes of it.

Right. Yeah. Not a kumbaya thing. More of a find out exactly what we're thinking, make sure that we're on the same page as one another, so that when we leave, we have a common understanding and we have called a rubric. You have something to point back to, to say, this is how we're going to act, this is where we're going to go. This is when we're going to do these things by. And this is the help that we need to remove the red tape. So, no, not a kumbaya thing. Something that is strictly for the outcome based scenario for you to leave knowing, hey, we're going to solve these things in this way with your people.

The outcomes is what I like. I don't want to go to a doctor, pay for something, and then not know what the cause of my tummy ache is.

Exactly.

We need to know the tummy ache.

How? Let's assume that we did this in the perfect way. Forget if it was a day, half a day, forget who's there. Assume that this was the best thing that has ever happened. You are over the moon because we accomplished everything that you wanted to accomplish. What does that success look like? Why were we so successful?

So success to me is the sales team, HR team, all agreeing that the company is the big thing that we're working for and trying to be on the same team and the same family. That's what I like to work towards. If we can have a roadmap of how to get there, if we can even just know the why or where this exactly came from and some options on how to solve it, I think that would be an incredible starting place. And if I can continue to kind of use you so that we can get it out little by little, that would. Maybe that would be the best case for what we're going through. It's just people are complex, and sometimes they just, like, I don't know, maybe the wrong person is on the bus? I don't know.

So can you give me just 1 second? My daughter's coming in the room right now. Hang on just a second.

Okay. Yeah, yeah, no worries. Have a couple kiddos myself. A couple grandkiddos, in fact.

Oh, yeah? How many? 1919 grandkids.

Most of them are cats.

Okay. All right. That's not weird at all.

No.

Who's your favorite? What's his or her name?

Bernice. Like the sauce.

Okay.

Bernays.

All right.

Is what my wife calls her. I call her Bernice, but, yeah, she's a sweet one. It's a cat, not a human.

Oh, okay. So my daughter left so really quick. I know your time's valuable. I want to go through a couple really fast things with you. We can schedule another call later. I always like to do some discovery calls one on one with a lot of different people from different departments, but just super high level right now. How many people do you think would come to this event?

1313 people.

Okay. And I'm assuming you already know kind of who those would be in your organization. Okay. And how long do you have before we need to solve this?

The water's already boiling, so the sooner the better.

Okay. All right. Sooner the better. How quickly are you able to kind of get everybody together for this day or half day or whatever this looks like?

Probably takes about two weeks to get calendar space for most of us.

Okay. Two weeks. So, to me, making sure that we're on the same calendar gives us a point to kind of go to and say, these are when we need to have our discovery calls in place by. To make sure that we can coordinate with your folks, make sure we have all that. So we'll pick something on the calendar. And then I like to bake, like a. Like a 70% product and get another phone call with you to say, hey, look, this is what I'm thinking. This is after the discovery calls with your people, this is what I think we need to work towards in order to solve what you're attempting to do in the most efficient way possible. And we'll kind of have that banter back and forth, tweak it and execute, and then get back to the way that you want things to run. It sounds like you have a really big heart, and getting everybody together to. To hash that out is. I think you're on the right path.

Yeah. I just want us to feel like family again.

Yeah, for sure.

Well, it sounds good. And I trust Peter's word. So I'm excited to see what magic you can create excellent.

Thank you. It was really nice talking to you, and I look forward to hearing from you in the future. I'll reach out to you here by the end of the week.

Of course. Thanks again, Jonald.

Take care.

I don't know how to do the dialed tone, so let me get out of character. Okay, so we're back. Whoa. That was intense, boss hog. I don't know what part of the country I was from, but I was from somewhere. John, thank you for walking us through that call and that experience. I think team building or cultural issues is a common call when it comes to workshops. It's not the only application. It could be anything big or small that we mentioned earlier. What were some of the key points or the things that you think are important to ask or look at when you're going through that conversation? I know you saw I had a big heart. I think that was a good touch.

But for sure, so realistically, there's a dividing line in playing a game and talking back and forth and what you would do in real life, right? There's a template that you can have and you can follow a template. You can make your own template. I have a different personality when I'm on a call with somebody that wants to get down to business, and what I generally do is I act incredibly transparent, incredibly bold with them, and I start from the back and work my way to the front. It was successful. Why was it successful? When do you want to accomplish this? How many people, who are those people going to be? What kind of space do you have available to you? When do you want to accomplish this? All these things that then bring me to the scene setting for the discovery, and then the discovery has a place to go. Not everybody likes that. So I didn't want to come out of the gate with that kind of approach, which is why the template is important. And that's kind of the thing that we want to get across to you is before you have that phone call, have it ready so that you can pull it out and kind of take those notes. Obviously, I should have been taking notes while he was talking. Wasn't really sure what kind of jokes he was going to throw at me, so I didn't want to come off of the page there. But most important thing is that, you know, going into this, that you're going to be successful based on what's in your head and you're not stretching yourself or them too thin. You. You have a plan in place, and you can accomplish what they've asked you to set out to accomplish.

100% agree. And I, more than John, probably follow a template, and I lean on the template. Before I start the conversation, I say, hey, look, I have seven or eight questions that I ask everyone just to get the information out there and organize our conversation. So if I sound a little robotic with some of these questions, it's just so we get the right information on the table, and then from there, the only other thing I can think of is sometimes when you're going through discovery, you want to start. You already want to start solving the problem or trying to solve it or promising to solve it. Discovery is about learning and not about providing every answer. So make sure you let them know. You need time to think. You want to call more people. Are there other individuals having this problem that we can talk to before you give a concrete solution? So that, yes, a workshop would work, but we want to make sure all the pieces are in place before we determine that. So that's something I've made the mistake.

Of before, for sure. There are so many ways to go about this. We tried to give you a very high level thing. Arguably, our. Our role play potentially, hopefully entertained you a little bit. I hope it actually gave you another lens into how some of these things could go, because you have no idea the weirdisms that could take place when you're on the phone with somebody or in person and just having the wherewithal to be able to get to the basics. What do I need to know? What do they need to know about me to be able to go forward with. With what we're working on? And I don't know how to end this.

I think you're another step closer to dangerous. So we'll see you at the venue.

Ah, look at that.

Good.

","Discovery Dive | https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/dangerous-the-fast-track-to-facilitation/lectures/39118875

Purpose of discovery:

Gather necessary information to set up the workshop effectively
Understand client needs, expectations, and context


Key components of discovery:

Client interview
Understanding the problem or challenge
Identifying participants and stakeholders
Determining workshop logistics (time, place, resources)


Discovery template:

Use a prepared template to guide the discovery process
Customize the template to fit your facilitation style and client needs


Important discovery questions:

What is the main problem or goal?
Who needs to be involved?
What's the timeline for solving the issue?
What's the desired outcome of the workshop?


Conducting the discovery call:

Be prepared with your questions
Listen actively and ask follow-up questions
Take detailed notes


Post-discovery actions:

Summarize findings and confirm understanding with the client
Use gathered information to design the workshop agenda
Plan for any necessary pre-workshop preparations


Tips for effective discovery:

Build rapport with the client
Be flexible in your approach
Aim to understand the underlying issues, not just surface-level problems"
Agenda Building,https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/dangerous-the-fast-track-to-facilitation/lectures/39118886,"So part one of building an agenda, or the agenda deep dive, the deep state agenda. No, that's not what this is called. So how do we build agendas? We both have different approaches, so I'm going to walk you through mine first. Now, we've talked about discovery, so you know our different tactics for or finding the information. Now we need to put the right tools in the right places to get the most out of everyone in the room. So when I do it, I'm going to give a visual aid. It's going to be, it could get prettier as we make more money from you loyal fans. Add us on Patreon. We don't have one of those, but I've heard them say it on podcasts. So what I like to do is build a flow. So this is what I do before every single workshop. You can seeithasastartandithasanend.Soatthestart,IknowIneedawarmup.SoI'mgoingto need some kind of warmup to usually add context. I'm also going to need an introduction. So I go introduction, warm up, find a warm up that I personally always find a warm up that relates to what we're trying to tackle. So if we're trying to tackle planning something that teaches them a lesson about planning, if we're trying to be more creative, teach them something about creativity if it's their first time ever, try and give them some context as to the importance of human centered design. So I try and play into my own strengths. So after I have that, I know I have two sections that I need to tackle, one being flare generating information, and one being focus, like literally limiting the options on the table. Now, I might go through that cycle twice in one workshop, given the amount of time, but I know this is high energy. So sometimes in between, in the middle of this roller coaster, I'm going to need a break because people are going to burn out. So I plan for that. Put the tools that I've researched in discovery together and then include some kind of wrap up. That's fun at the end. And that would be my agenda. Now, I turn it into a format that normal people can understand. Sometimes people want it in an excel sheet. I honestly still don't know how to use an excel sheet, so I avoid that. I type it up on word. I try and use the most basic language possible and not design language, not workshop language, so that they can understand the value of each exercise and potentially some of the intention behind it. Now, if I really don't want them to know, because they will try and do things to my agenda. Then I just give them it in the most ridiculous wording possible so that they just have to trust me. And that's essentially how I build a workshop. I also throw in, in this estimated time, estimated time for each exercise, estimated time when I need to take a break. And then from there, I'm pretty confident it'll work. I call that a flow. That's a Di masaguto special from Spain. That's who I learned workshopping from. So shout out to him, I guess. Can we shout out?
Shout out. Yeah, shout out.
But, John, you have a different approach. You don't build a roller coaster. What do you build and how do you put it together? Is it an excel?
Well, it can be, yes. So I use a lot of different tools, but the approach that I take is after going through the discovery, understanding why we're there, exactly what they need to have the best product. I work, you know, from the back to the front.
Right.
And I go, okay, what would I absolutely love to do with this group? And I go through, and it's very similar. I just spit. If you saw that. I'm sorry, excuse me. Yeah, it probably went over that way.
You watered a plant on the ground.
So I go through very similar phases of what you have, but I go, I say to myself, okay, they just came in. Did the workshop start at 12:00 or did it start at 09:00 in the morning? Or did it start at 07:00 in the morning? Good call. Do they need a lot of energy, or do they need something to kind of bring them in very softly? And I come up with a couple reasons, a couple things that I think would be excellent. And then I just keep going through as if I'm them. All right, I'm them. I don't know what we're about to go through. How am I going to trust John unless your name is something else? How am I going to trust this person to bring me from this point to the end? And so I try to do a little bit of credibility building, and that's typically meant to show them very, very quick results in a short amount of time so that they buy into what we're doing. Anyways, fast forward. I do this for every element across the entire workshop. And so I get to the end and there is no time associated with it. Is just like, this is my perfect agenda. No matter how long this takes, this would be the best agenda. And then I go, okay, well, how do I fit this square peg in a round hole. Do I have more time? Do I have less time? And then I start to build out, okay, what would supplement these things to make it, you know, fill time? And I don't mean fluff, I mean actually meaningfully pull, put the right thing in there, even if that is removing stuff entirely and giving people a chance to breathe. Right. Or what are the things that I could take away and still achieve the desired result that I'm looking for? And so I start to squeeze those things into the time space that I have. I also have a very frank conversation with the person that's bringing me on and saying, look, I'm going to create an agenda, but the second we start, we essentially throw that agenda out the window. Yes, I've planned it over and over again, and I have my path that I want to go down. But if things are going really, really, really well and we're having a meaningful discussion about something, and it's just beautiful, I don't want to stop that and move on to the next thing if your goal is culture and communication. Right. So I try to pay attention in the moment. I tell the person that brought me on, we're going to change this agenda, so don't fall in love with it. We're going to remove stuff, we're going to add stuff. If things are not working or people don't have the correct buy in, then I need to actually rewind a little bit to catch that buy in a little bit. The thing I typically tell them is I've done so many experiments on people actually getting to know each other, get comfortable, have fun, versus people that just go in to get the business done.

Yeah.
And they're almost always faster, more efficient, more effective. They have more fun. And it's actually, it actually feels good to be around those people, as opposed to the let's just get inthereandgetitdonetypeofthing.Sothatwasalot.ButItakealotofstuffandIputit together and I.
Shake it up and, well, it's funny because what you said at the end is one thing that I was, you know, kept thinking as an important piece that when I build my agenda, I focus on trying to make it as much an experience as possible. It's funny because we like what we do, mimics user experience a lot. When you leave one of my workshops, I want you to remember it the same way you remember waiting in line at Disney Worlds. You have to wait in line at Disney World sometimes. Right. And that experience is incredible. There's always stuff going on, it's pleasurable, and then you get to go on the ride. When you go to my workshop, it's not a meeting. When you go to our workshops, they are not meetings. And we want that to be an experience that expands and that you remember positively. It's not just a struggle that you got through. It's something you enjoyed, and then you want to come back and do more of.
Yeah.
So that's an important piece of the agenda, I guess.
I hate standing in line, but I will stand in line if it is a meaningful experience. So, boom, stand in line with us together.","Agenda Building | https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/dangerous-the-fast-track-to-facilitation/lectures/39118886

Your Role as a facilitator,https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/dangerous-the-fast-track-to-facilitation/lectures/39118891,"So the day has come. Your workshop is happening. You are there and ready to go. But now what? What is your role as a facilitator? We haven't even talked about that. How do you manage the people in the room? So, in this module, we're going to go over all of that. You as a facilitator, your participants, and how you keep them engaged. So to get everything started, let's kick it off with what is your role as a facilitator?

Did you ask me that?

Yeah. That wasn't so. What is your role as a facilitator? In 20 seconds? No.

Oh, noooooooo

I'm just kidding.

Okay, I'll just. I will try to be quick. Role as a facilitator. This is me. This is what I think it is as a facilitator. It is to.

To.

Basically capture the buy in and be the forcing function to the outcome you're looking towards. So if you need to accomplish x, how do you get these people to accomplish x? So that when you leave, you've done what you set out to do? I was as succinct as I could possibly make it.

I like it. It reminds me of my dad used to always tell me a good referee was like a good waiter. You don't really notice they're there, but yet you ate your food and had a really nice time. I think the role of facilitator sometimes is like that. Your job is to keep everyone moving, keep everyone happy, keep progress happening. Yet other times, you're kind of the bad. The bad person in the room, the one taking the heat, the one pressuring them to go forward faster. So you have to walk the line, and you have to be really self aware as you do that. The rules we mentioned in the other one can help establish that role that you have in the room as kind of controlling what's happening. Not everybody will want to give you that control, but establishing that early or establishing that at some point in time is going to help you fulfill your role. So you're going to have to manage people in the room. You're going to have to manage time. Sometimes you're gonna have to manage snacks. Your role as facilitator is to keep people focused on topic and to get to the goal of the day.

I think you said better than me, I was trying to do it in 20 seconds. I could have done a little bit better if you gave me more time, but I think that you are spot on. And the element that I will add to that is when we say your job as a facilitator. They are not the same as the person to the left or the right of you based on your personality. So you're not going to do what Johnny does, because you're not Johnny. And Johnny can get a room to love him for saying the worst joke ever and nobody laughs. And that's like his personality, and that's something that I can potentially do. But if that's not your personality, you have to tweak this to be able to accomplish that end goal using your personality. So if it's not jokes and humor, it could potentially be lists and to dos and requests that you have of people in the room. There are a lot of things that you can do to capture the most out of your personality as a facilitator.

All right, so, 22nd summary. Your role is to be noticed and be not noticed by managing people effectively and efficiently. Heard the group from being lost little sheeps to the promised lands of. Yay. We got this done. High five. Without too many. Too many wheels falling off along the way of the sheep. Does sheep have wheels?

Yep.

I think that's overall snapshot, what you should do. I think that's all you need to know on your pathway to facilitation. Remember, you're zero to dangerous. So as much as you want to do everything, know that your job really is simple. It is to help people get from point a to point b by providing the process and the framework for that process. That doesn't mean you have to answer every single question. That doesn't mean you have to provide every single idea. You're not there to be the expert on everything. You're there to be the expert on facilitation. I think that's a big difference.

And now I'm going to say one more thing, because you gave me another idea. If you're doing this with a group of people and you are not the sole facilitator, if there's several of you that are sharing that role, based on what Johnny said, you don't have to do everything. You don't have to boil the ocean yourself. You can get some help from the person on the left of you and the person on the right of you, and you can focus on that one thing or two things that means the most to you and your group so that you're using your strengths together to have that successful event.

Exactly. Facilitate. Away, come, facilitate. Away.

Come, facilitate. It doesn't work. Too many syllables.

Where do I workshop?,https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/dangerous-the-fast-track-to-facilitation/lectures/39118898,"Room layout, venue location, venue selection, lots of things going on. In order to actually figure out how do we get people in this space and moving around and being productive. So we're going to try and walk through what we do for venue. But I'm also going to pose a question to john and let's see how he draws up how he would lay out the venue. So we'll start with, we know that onsite versus offsite can be a problem, but we're going to talk about that after. Let's just deal with this scenario. So I'm going to give you some pen and paper. I have my own. Just in case I feel like drawing it up. We're going to go through a scenario. Okay. You know, you have a workshop for 13 people. You can pick the location. If you can be your dream location, I'm feeling generous. You know that you have 5 hours of time, so probably need a lot of wall space. When I think about that 5 hours of time or the ability to interchange walls, I'm giving away tips. Okay, so you got 5 hours of time. You got 13 people. The room already has three tables in it, but they can be moved. How do you go about setting up the room? What else do you need to know in order to set up the room?
You said three tables.
Three tables are already in the room. There's two walls that are flat. There's one wall that isn't sticky.
This is a lot of information. Okay. One wall that's sticky. One wall is a window.
It's a window.
Sorry. I'm very, very visual, descriptive. Okay. How are you going to lay out the room? Say you don't know what exercises you're going to do, but there probably are many. You know, they're searching people. It's an odd number, so you kind of have to factor in. How do you set up and divide the groups, space them correctly. You need them to be able to comfortably walk around so that they can get to what they're actually trying to work on. These are kind of the things that are going on in my head as I go through it. The other things I think of. If there's that many people and I have this much time, the physical space that putting post its on the wall or putting flip charts on the wall will be means I might have to rotate the order of things on the wall. So I lead them through a handful of exercises, remove those, roll them up, label them with the team number, which I will put on each table, but also take pictures before I roll them up. Expert tip. And then put up the second round of exercises that we're going to finish with. John, what did you. How did you divide the room? You have different style than me. So 13 people, five hour workshop.
I got excited. You threw a lot of information out of me. I had no idea what you were going to do, and I completely wong it. Okay. So I decided that this was the window here. You had three tables, and essentially, you've provided yourself with four spaces to work standing up for three groups. Three groups of four to five people. 13 people. You got a space over here, space over here, and space over here. So those three groups can be as far away as possible so they don't hear each other. They each have their own table that they can then go and use either for lunch, snacks, or some kind of sit down thing. And then you've got this whole space over here that's wide open for when you want to do potentially something for the entire group and not in three distinct groups in that group. That's how I design mine.
I like it. I like it. I took a quick shot at it, too. You drew circle tables? I prefer square tables, but I drew circle tables. I gambled and said that the walls that were able to be used in the window were all in this direction. I used the window as one team, the two walls as the other team, like John did. I try to separate them as much as possible so that when talking, they didn't get in each other's way. The tables I spaced out, I always put, say, this is team one. They're going to section one. They're as close as possible, but they still have to get up and move.
Yep.
So they can be comfortable for a bit. And then I make them stand up and walk over here.
You look at yourself right now?
Yeah. Okay. So I also put my presentation point, where I'm going to be talking from, at a location that's equally awkward and beneficial to everybody.
Sweet.
And that's probably the snapshot of the venue layout. Now, there are other factors that could come in. There could be an AC unit right here and right here that is blowing continuously. Could you shut it? Could you block it? Could you do something to still use that wall space? A lot of times you're assigned a room and you can't change anything about it, meaning the table is a conference table that weighs 400,000 pounds and is made out of black matter. So you literally. It's heavier than gravity. Right? I don't know.
There's something like that. Okay, thank you.
So it exists.

You have to work around with what. You have to work around with what you've got. Do you have any scenarios that you have made lemons out of lemonade?
Yes, absolutely. You know, I was told up and down we were about to do a workshop and that the table in the center of the room could be moved. And little did everybody know it could not be moved. And so every plan that you have to get a group together, standing up in a circle, any kind of improv thing that you had, you kind of have to like, throw everything out the window. So knowing what is in that room is super important. So here are a couple things that you can do. One, request it right. Ask for what you need in order to be successful. And do not be afraid to tell them that room is not going to work with what you've asked me to do. And the more confident you are in saying that, the more they will believe and trust that you know what you're talking about and they're going to help you if they say there is nothing that we can do. If it really is that bad, you should consider saying, I'm sorry, I'm not the right person for this because you're going to set yourself up potentially for failure. Right. The other thing that you can do is case the place before it happens. Ask them to take pictures and send you those pictures from every angle. Don't just say, can you send me a picture? Can you take a picture from all four corners or seven, depending on what kind of weird looking shaped room it is. You want every picture that you can so that you can mentally think through. This is where they're going to come in. This is where they're going to eat. This is where they're going to sleep. You know, like all of the above. The things that they are going to do in that workshop. How does noise travel, et cetera? Ask those questions out loud. Is it carpet on the ground or not? Is it an industrial space or not? Like, these are things that you really need to consider when you're breaking people out to accomplish what you want. Is your voice going to carry across the entire thing or be super annoying that it rattles everywhere and nobody will be able to hear you? There is an awkward moment behind every reason that we are telling you this, that we experience ourselves. And really the best way to get around all that is arrive at the place beforehand. And I don't just mean an hour early, I mean potentially a week or two beforehand so that you can build your agenda around that space, because it.
Does become a huge factor. Like I said, I personally had to go through four teams in four teams of people in a space where not even enough seats would fit at a conference table for that many people, which means there's not enough wall space for everyone to actually share their ideas, which means I have to come prepared with layers. So it is pretty cool when you set it up and you're, like, done with that exercise. Foom. And then there's the next exercise right there. It is cool. It also is not very practical because then all the visuals are such a big advantage. You can see everything you've done for the whole day. You can see and build on each one and not get lost in that thread of the story that is so important, and I would have to tear it down and lose that beauty. So very important. The earlier you can see the room, the better. I think we both know that putting everything in a location that's easy, easy for people to reach, easy for people to get to and from, knowing how noise travels in the room, outside of the room, if you're in an office space, so that you don't have any angry people coming up mid workshop. We also know about AC and how important that can be. I think if

you can know, maybe the room is small, is there an outside space that we can get to, to do some kind of noisy events to get the people hyped and then come back in and work? John, I look like you were drawing another tip. That is very important. Let's say tip number two.
You captured one of them. That's this arrow, so you must have. We had ESPN, right? So that's a walkabout. That's a, you know, how far away are you from allowing people to kind of stretch their legs and get going? The other one is how far away you are from the bathroom. How far away are you from egress to be able to safely exit the building if something crazy were to happen and all the post it notes suddenly caught fire. This is important stuff. Typically, the very first thing you say in an introduction or the host, this is where you need to go to the bathroom. This is where you need to go to get food. And in the case of emergency, this is where you're going to go so that we can account for everybody that's here. So there's also something that is. I'm shifting gears entirely, but you mentioned it, and I want to make sure that I capture it here. Admittedly, I was put on the spot for this, so I would not build my agenda or my space. This way without a tweak. Don't put the wall space and the table of the same group right next to each other because this is what's going to happen. Everybody is going to take a seat in this wall. If they're part of that table, they're all going to sit around this table. They're going to say, we don't need to stand up.
Yeah, it's more comfortable.
It's way more comfortable to sit down. Instead, this group goes here, that group goes there. This group comes over here. So that you make people stand when they need to stand. You make people sit when they need to sit. And you give the people that you shouldn't be deciding their fate the option to do either.
Agree. Great tip. Any other points on venue? I think we covered room layout. We covered the live room. We mentioned layout. As far as location of putting things and how to put things and accessibility for everyone. I think with this video you actually have just learned like five years of you're on the fast track to facilitation, that, you know, could you just send this back to me five years ago? That would be great.
There are some subtleties that you're going to have to know for your own organization, for yourself, etcetera, that you don't want to just take what we have and say, that's it. Because there are other things that we haven't had a chance to talk about that are one offs of venues that didn't open in time or venues that said that they close at five and they legitimately, you could get locked in the building because they really are shutting down at five and that person stops getting paid at 05:01 and they don't want to wait around for you, so you might get interrupted from them. So knowing where you're going, knowing who's in charge of that space and making friends with them, is worth its weight in gold. Showing up early and giving them a cookie or high five, or getting to know something about their personal life so that they help you when you need it. Whether it's a technological problem, whether it's a table that won't move, so they give you another table or space, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

The list goes on. You'd be nice to people, you know, it helps. Yeah. So venue, I think we put a nice bow on that.
Agreed. Okay.","Where do I workshop? | https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/dangerous-the-fast-track-to-facilitation/lectures/39118898

"Actually checking it, before wrecking it",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/dangerous-the-fast-track-to-facilitation/lectures/39119133,"Check it before you wreck it. Terrible. Okay, so you were about to go in with something else. So check it before you wreck it. What do we mean by that? That's the day of. The workshop hasn't started yet. You're nervous. Your pits are sweating a bit. It happens to everyone.

You've gone to the bathroom four or five times. It happens to all of us.

It happens to everyone. It's game day. That's what happens. What do you need to check before the workshop starts so that you can be prepared for as much as possible? That's what this section's about. So to make it as easy as possible, we've made another little thing. We did a thing. We made the facilitators checklist, John. Right.

Yeah.

That are kind of our best tips for avoiding some simple hurdles that might become huge as you get in the workshop. So, John, we have three different categories. The venue, the tech, and the materials. Can you walk us through the different things you check on game day to make sure nothing catches on fire or no one gets lost on the way to the bathroom?

Yeah, so I'm a little weird. I mentally walk myself through the space in every way. So I pretend that I am an attendee that's on their way. I walk myself through as if they have no idea where they are, where they need to go, how they need to go, where do they sit? Do they sit when they come in? Are their name cards? Like, I walk through that whole thing. I do the same thing if it's the host, the same thing if it's the boss. And I try to think through, like, what could go wrong if you are this person or that person or this group or that group. And then I think through everything that happened, is the door going to be unlocked? So some places only open at eight and you wanted to start at 815. Is that enough time for you to get in to make sure the door is unlocked? Is the bathrooms are functioning? Actually go in and use them, or have somebody use the other one to make sure that they actually work. Running water. Is there a place for people to get drinks? Are the doors unlocked in the hallways from one place to the other? Do the lights work? Do you actually know how to use the lights? Because a lot of places will only turn on this one or all of them, or some of them, and some of them are hot and get there early. Check the lights, check the. Anyways, I could keep going, but these are things that you just mentally walk yourself through. What will I need at any given point in my workshop? Or our workshop. And will it actually work? What did I miss for venue?

No, that was pretty solid. So some simple rules. We have them right here. As simple as you can get. Make sure the chairs are far enough apart so everyone can comfortably sit. Also, far enough from the wall so they can get up and get out without hitting anyone and creating fire hazard. Other things, when you put things on the wall, don't put them over a vent of an AC or below a vent of an AC, or you'll have, like, essentially butterflies of post its fluttering across the room. Those are the bigger ones. Also check the temperature of the ac. Colder can be better, but colder can be worse. So I lean towards cold until people complain about it and then flip. Cause that's worse than sweaty people.

Can we? Let's pause on that really quick. Some places take a really long time to cool down. And so if you think you're going to get there and 30 minutes before change the ac, which, oh, by the way, you might not be able to change the ac, you might need somebody at the place who has the key to the little thingy who can change the ac.

More often than not, it's gonna be a key thing. Someone's job is just to control the ac.

It's true. So make sure you can get to it. Preferably you would talk to the host or the venue to ensure that they change it to the temperature that you want the night before. But. Aha. They might have an automatic system that only cuts on at this time or that time, and they need permission to do one thing or another. Think so far in advance that when people get there, they're comfortable.

That's a simple one that can kind of throw everyone off. That's all. I think we need to go on venue. But tech can be a problem, even if you're a tech master. I've had many tech mayors. Can we call them that? A nightmare of tech?

Sure.

Tech mayors. So the things I try and took me a second try and do to avoid those techmares, which is coins, trademarked. First thing I do, always check if I can. If I have a presentation, can I play it somewhere? And if there is a somewhere, at least test that it'll work. Next thing, if I'm playing something, I have my computer plugged in at all times because too many of time, my presentation has cut off the screen because my computer died. The next thing is Wi Fi. It's just good to know the password, because almost everyone in the room will ask you at some point because they think you're in charge, even if it's not your workspace. Last thing that I really look for is wires. Wires on the ground, something that people can trip on. Not that anyone's ever tripped on it besides myself, but it's good to just be prepped. And my dad's a lawyer, so I'm always afraid I'm going to get sued. So it's just good to think of those things. Also, a clicker for your presentation, if you do have one. Definitely. Lifesaver makes you look way more professional, and it really doesn't cost that much.

And if it works on your computer 30 minutes before everybody goes there, don't assume that it's going to work three minutes before you start, because even if you've planned everything through, it will go wrong. And your contingency should be, how do I actually proceed if it does go wrong? Do I have printouts? Do I have stuff written on the board as opposed to a PowerPoint? Do I have slides I can pass out? What do you have if the presentation goes awry? And I always like to think, how could you show up at the middle of a basketball court with nothing around you and provide what you're attempting to do for your audience? If you can think through that, the technology won't get in the way. And the last thing I'll say on it before this video gets way too long is if it works on a Mac, it won't work on the other one and vice versa. Even if you think you know what you're doing in the moment, if it's not your computer and you need to switch something up, make sure that you've tested it out on anything that will actually be in operation that day. It's game day.

It's game day. Bring a speaker for music. Have a playlist prepared. I think those are pretty much the two most important tips. Besides keeping your phone on silence. Keeping your phone on silent can be easy to forget. So just go through the checklist. It'll be smarter than us a lot of the time and you'll be fine. The only other thing there is to check, really, is that you have the materials on you or laid out as if the workshop is about to start. I like to make everything look very pretty so that when people come in the room, it's a bit of an experience. John probably does something similar. I've never stalked him from a window to see his workshop.

I do the same thing with materials that I do for the venue. I go through every module that I'm about to do and say I write off to the side, what does this module require? Does it require post its? How many post its? What happens if I run out markers? Does it require something on the wall? And I basically make sure that I have this, you know, side rubric of everything I need. I check that list, make sure that it's good. Is it in place? Does it stick to the wall? That's a huge one.

Buy posted brands. I'm not trying to. I'm not trying to, like, advertise for them, but office depot post its, the ones off of Amazon that are some random name, they don't stick. I don't know what magic is right here. I know the story of it. I know it wasn't meant to be. Sticky stuff, rubber alternative. It works. Just spend way too much money on these small squares.

And even if it does work, it might not work on the surface of the wall that you're attempting to do.

Correct.

So all we're trying to say, if you didn't want to watch all of this, it's too late, is pretend that it is game day and go through the steps that your people, the participants, will go through in every way, shape or form. Because no matter how many times you've done something, it's their first time. And you have to keep that in mind. The confusion that you have when you go to a hospital and they expect you to just know where to go to get somewhere, that's the confusion that your participants are going to have when they show up for your thing and they see all these pretty colors and they don't know what to do with the materials that are at hand. Make it easy for them, make it comfortable, et cetera.

Right. So check it before you wreck it, the venue, your tech and the materials, and you'll be good to go for game day. We'll see you there.

Keep it going.

It's on. No, it's flashing.

Gopro, turn on. GoPro, start recording. Would have been on if it was on. Now it's off. GoPro, start recording. Hi.

Hi. There we go.

This is. Check it before you wreck it. Take one.

Managing People,https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/dangerous-the-fast-track-to-facilitation/lectures/39119010,"You already know your role as a facilitator, a big piece of that. Managing people. How do you manage people and who are you managing in this next, hopefully nine minutes? We're going to walk you through. Not again. We're going to walk you through five Personas. Personas are people that we commonly run into in workshops. We're going to walk you through those and how to manage them. So I'm going to kick us off. I'm going to describe one of the Personas and then the characteristics they have, and we'll do that over and over again until we reach through the five. Ready, set, talk. Okay, so it's my turn to talk. So boss Persona number one. The boss is the guy or girl who wants to control the room. They really, really focus on having their ideas and everything, having their actions in everything. That can be detrimental to a workshop. It can be detrimental to the confidence of a group. So, John, how do you deal with this boss?

Couple ways. I mean, there's a lot. This is a very high level for all of these.

10,000 foot, maybe 12,000. So this tall, still pretty high.

This tall. It's still tall.

Okay.

Out of the screen, you can basically pull them away from the main group, put them in a smaller subgroup, potentially with people, you know, that can handle their personality very well and that they complement each other, or just so that when they when they do try to control too much, you've you've consolidated that into one area and you don't kind of disrupt the rest of the group. That's kind of push them off into their own and make sure that their voice is heard, but not too much.

We don't want them to be a puppet master controlling everyone. So we kind of have to manage them by doing that. That's definitely a simple approach that can be repeated. Now, when we look at Persona number two, we'll call them seasoned. Susan. Now, this person is a veteran in the organization. Maybe they've been around for 1520 years.

They're a veteran. Like, they went. They were in the military.

They are experienced in the organization, not in military necessarily. So they think they have the answer to everything. Cause they've seen it before, they've done it before, they've tried it before. So they're gonna shoot down all the ideas. So how do we manage season? Susan.

So one of the things that you can do is use their, I'll call it weakness as a strength for the group. There is a strength there, too. It is to have their role be to actually find the pitfalls. Find out why something didn't work long ago, or why it might not work, and have them play that devil's advocate role. That will help you kind of figure out before something breaks why it might and kind of shore yourself up with the right thoughts and ideas going into that. Another way that you can do it is to call on them as a subject matter expert in that group so that you can say, hey, you all tried this before. Why did it not work when you did it? And what do you think that we can do differently this time to reach success?

Use them as a positive resource as opposed to a negative. Another thing I like to do is convince them that timing is an extremely important factor to the success of ideas. So the quickest story I can give is Webvan had the wonderful idea of getting you groceries in a few clicks, but they had it in the early two thousands and they went bankrupt in about two years. Instacart's now worth several billion dollars. They had the idea at the right time and executed at the right time. So timing is everything in that context. So just because it didn't work then doesn't mean it won't work now. Next Persona. We're going to call them the engineer brain. The engineer brain is a person who loves process. In fact, they need it to survive. They may be an engineer typing, they may be an engineer of nuclear stuff like this guy. Whatever it is, they thrive on process. How do we help them understand a process that they don't know about and get them through the day?

For them to know an agenda is one of them. You tell them, this is where you are in the agenda. This is what we've accomplished so far, and this is where we're going. You don't have to drill down micro and say, these are the exact modules we're going to do and how long they're going to take. But as long as they know that they're going to achieve something in this process, you're going to kind of calm that anxiety, and some of that anxiety in the back of their head is going to, are we doing what we set out to do? Is this workshop or meeting on track, or are we kind of just out there? Right. And allowing them to know this is where we're at will kind of calm them down. Another thing that you can do is explain things to them in significant detail without ruining it to the group and taking too long. You can have some notes written out for participants to to dive in deeper if they need to. When they break out into groups so that they have something else to read and understand a little bit more in depth where the group is and what they're attempting to accomplish.

Yeah, and when given the time, you can always pull them aside and have a little one on one explaining the steps so that maybe you don't have to explain it to everyone. Cause that might be too much information for the majority.

Now I'm giggling because you said one on one. And I was thinking John on John on John.

Some John on John. Check that out on MTV 1989. So next, Persona shy Sam. They are a quiet individual. They often sit farthest away from the presentation or the presenter. They have good ideas, but they might just hide them because they're not comfortable kind of opening up to the crowd. Or even if it's a tight knit group of a team, they might just be a quiet individual. So how do we pull that value out of them?

So one thing you can do is, you know, during a break or something like that, you can spark up a conversation that might not have anything to do with what you're working on in the moment. And as the break comes back, potentially this is a hard one to pull off. But walk away from them a little bit and get them to speak louder in order for. For you to hear them and potentially other people as you kind of go into the workshop or meeting another one, is to elicit response asynchronously. So have everybody kind of write an idea down and throw it in a bucket as they walk past. It allows his or her voice to be heard while it goes in the bucket, before it goes in the bucket afterwards. So that when you read it as the facilitator, they might not want to defend what they put out there. And that's fine. At least their idea or their thought was able to elicit some kind of discussion from the rest of the group.

Fantastic power of the post it. Don't forget it. And I did like the physical distance. I think that's a cool tip. It can be a tough one, but I personally have seen it work and I have been tricked by it personally, myself a victim of it. So the final one, oversharer. This is an individual who, they talk way too much. They're consuming our time, they're consuming everyone's time, and maybe some of the information they have is fantastic, but a lot of it turns out to be fluff. So how do we control the over share so that we get the most out of them without limiting them too much, but also without losing the magic of the group?

You can time box that individual, you can say, hey, everyone is going to get 15 seconds to say just the idea and only the idea, not why it's going to work, not why you think it's the best idea, but just very briefly, here's the idea. Or if it's a little bit more in depth, hey, everybody has a minute. Potentially, you set a timer. You allow that timer to go off and very loudly so that you're like, okay, time's up, and you can move to the next person. Another thing that you can do is you can call on somebody that's not that person. You can say, what do you think? Or, what do you think? Or you can say, hey, we want to hear from somebody that hasn't had a chance to speak yet. Or my favorite is you can say, hey, we want to hear from one of these people. You make it physical. There might be ten people over there, and they're all kind of playing the penguin on the edge of the iceberg game, who's going to fall off first and be eaten by the seals. And then you kind of narrow the scope. I want to hear from one of these people, and now it's five, and now it's three. And then pretty soon you're pretty much just pointing to one individual, and you say, I want to hear from one of these people. And. And then obviously that whole pie narrowing, or whatever you want to call it, did not include the overshare, and that's how you could get somebody else to talk.

Beautiful. So those are the five Personas we commonly run into. Since this is your ten to 12,000 foot view, according to John, we know that you might have other Personas or individuals that you run into frequently. So we've created a PDF that you can fill in yourself to create your own Persona to help manage your own situation. We've noticed these the most, and these are the tactics we use to help get the most out of the group and manage people. You do your thing, you make it your way. Use our information as a guide, but then definitely expand upon it and then send us all the good stuff.

Stuff, for sure.

Can we ask that?

Yeah. Okay.

Send us stuff.

Yeah.

Okay.

Buy-in Creation,https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/dangerous-the-fast-track-to-facilitation/lectures/39119030,"You've got a room full of people that don't know you or maybe do know you. You've got a workshop on your hands. How do you convince them to trust you through this chaotic process that's not your normal meeting and be that smiling giraffe hugging a tree? How do you get buy in creation? John, you're here today with me. He's been here the whole time. You're here today with me to talk about tools and tactics to develop that buy in. So when I run a workshop, I have certain strategies for creating buy in as fast as possible. One of my favorites is my introduction, which is essentially my life story in three minutes for two reasons. One, I love to talk about myself especially, but two, I get very personal, and I can already target the people that are relating to me or pushing away, because that's a little bit too much information for a professional setting. So I already can pinpoint that the second thing that I like to do is an exercise, which you can find in warmups. That's lateral thinking. I call it the roman six. So, using that exercise, my personal goal is to make myself kind of look smarter than everyone else because it's an obvious answer, but unless you're thinking outside the box, you'll never arrive to it. So by sharing that with a group, sharing that with the group, I establish, hey, this guy knows a little bit of stuff about this whole lateral thinking thing. I guess I'll hold on for the rest of the ride. What do you do to make people trust you? That's not talking about breaking up with your ex in Spain.

That's what I do. That's great. Okay, so there's a few things. My favorite one is to use the boss or the most tenured person there as my support, and I kind of ride their coattails in. So a couple examples of that, again, high level would be, I get them to mess up on purpose. I have a conversation with them before we even start and say, look, this is what I need from you. This is when I'm going to do it. This is about what it will be, and this is what I need you to do. So I might say as an example, okay, we're about to do this workshop or this module on X, y, and Z, and I don't want anybody to say anything out loud, but I might have gone back to the boss and said, hey, when I get to that part, I want you to tell me.

Yours out loud, sneaky.

And then I will actually interrupt them and I will say out loud to that person. Hey, actually I said, I know you're really excited, but I said no talking. And I do it in a fun loving way. But that establishes a couple things. One, it tells everybody in the room if I cut that person off, then nobody is above being cut off. Whether you're seasoned, Susan, or you are the boss in your own domain, or you're an overshare or whatever, you know that I can cut you off at any given time. And it's not personal. It is about the rules that we're laying out, et cetera. Another one is the introduction that the host potentially provides to you. And it can be as simple as, hey, we have Johnny here today. I'm really excited for everybody here. I know you're going to get a ton out of it. X, Y and Z, you are establishing your credibility via another human being, which is always a really good, warm introduction to you to have that buy in. Another one, another one. I'm talking a lot. I'm being an oversharer.

Another one, another one. What's the third one? People love threes.

Yeah, okay. I didn't actually have one. Now I have to make one up. No, a third one could be that you. Well, now I lost my train of thought, actually. Give me 1 second. It's coming. We said another one and I was thinking of. So, yeah, go ahead.

One thing that I found doesn't always work as an opposite to that is essentially showing up with a stack full of credentials. Although it's a nice piece of paper, a lot of times people don't see any value in that. So unless it's like a degree from MIT, I don't know how you're going to convince people with a piece of paper.

There's no offense to you. If you do have that, those are awesome.

That is great for your knowledge and your learning. It just doesn't reel people in in the same way.

And nobody wants to hear it. Honestly, when you actually hear somebody give an intro or a bio of themselves and they give you, this is what I've done, and it's just like your eyes begin to roll and you're like, it's over for me. I don't like to listen to that. I like to hear them as a human being. If you stripped away all those things that they said, who are they as a human being? And that's why I'm going to listen to them and their energy is going to bring me in. So the third one, that actually reminded me of what I was going to say. It's perfect. Thank you, you saved. It is I try to do a very, very quick module that I know for a fact will work and it will achieve some desired outcome in a very short amount of time. That will prove to everybody, look what we were able to do in eleven minutes. And if we could do it in that amount of time, imagine what we'll do for the rest of the day. That type of buy in creation says to them, hey, there's a method to the madness. If the facilitator is going to ask me to do this, I know it's going to lead to an end result and I'm all in.

So give them a small bite of the full experience. That's boom. Solid. Buy in creation, people. You need it. Now you have it.

This is buy in creation. Not like buy in, buy in creation.

Buy in, take one. Scene one.

Mental Sherbert,https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/dangerous-the-fast-track-to-facilitation/lectures/39119046,"This is mental sherbet. Sherbet?

Chavon, what is this about? The title of this is mental Sherbet? Kumbaya. Without Kumbaya.

Oh. Oh. That's what we have written.

That's what. Yeah, that's what we have written.

Okay.

You're asking me what is mental sherbet?

Yeah. So it would be cold.

Where can I get a scoop of it?

So good. Terrible. It's terrible. Terrible. Terribly good. Delicious. Okay, so it would be called mental sorbet, technically, but sorbet doesn't sound. It doesn't, like, roll off the tongue. Mental sorbet. It just makes you not somebody that I want to hang out with.

So what is it?

So we call it mental sherbet. Sorbet, I believe, is what you eat in between meals to cleanse the palate.

Palate cleanser.

I call this mental sherbet, which is. I should have trademarked. It is around people. I've heard people talk.

I've heard it. Some guy, I was walking down the street and he was yelling at me. Yeah.

I don't know how that would've. Okay. It is to cleanse the mind before moving on to something else. An example would be, you are talking about something very abstract or specific, and you need to get to the abstract, or you need to get to the specific. You need to break the conversation, give everybody the chance to kind of let loose.

Buffer zone.

It's a buffer zone. Is exactly right. It's a buffer zone from the conversation you're currently having to the next one. And there's this awkwardness to go from one to the next. Mental sherbet is like, it's an icebreaker that has purpose. Most icebreakers, I should say, all have purpose. So if you're ever about to do an icebreaker, it should always have purpose. We can get into that another time. But this is. Mental sherbet is the icebreaker that you do in between. That kind of brings everybody into that next conversation.

That's beautiful. A palate cleanser. Now, what do you use to palate cleanse? Do you have tools and tactics?

Yeah.

I mean, or best practices or.

Yeah, so some of them. Sometimes I call it out. Sometimes I say, look, this is the conversation we're currently having. This is the conversation I want to have. There's no real way to do this without being super awkward. So me saying this out loud is the awkwardness that's going to get us there. That's mental sherbet, which.

Blah, blah, blah.

I talk about it, people are like, oh, that's cool. Or get off. Get off. We don't want to hear this guy anymore. And it allows you to go to the next one. Another example. Another one is where you just do a very general icebreaker, something super, super quick. Turn to the person to the left or the right of you and say, the vacation spot that you're going to be on seven years from now in the winter, something that is just very strange, very weird, gets everybody to do it, and now their mind is somewhere else. It's the same thing that I do when my daughter's like, she has a really bad dream, and she's like, I've been dreaming about volcanoes. And she comes in and I go, flying zebras. She's like, flying zebras. And I go, what are you thinking about right now? And she's like, flying zebras. And I'm like, exactly.

That's beautiful. That's beautiful. No, I get it. So the example that my mind jumped to was I had a group of people that were pretty exhausted and very tired of dealing with one another. And we were talking about the problems. We got to the idea part, and we needed to get to the execution part, but they just didn't have, like, they were so focused on these ideas that they couldn't, like, move to execution. So I made them play this ping pong game where you have to pass ping pong balls between each other, and you can't touch two ping pong balls at the same time. And you can have unlimited ping pong balls. But originally you start with three. Anyways, long story short, they enjoyed it. One of them got punched in the face, which was less enjoyable. It reset the whole group, and then we were able to sit down and have a real conversation about how to execute these ideas.

Because they got punched in the face or because of the ping pong balls?

Well, she was the one who was being the meanest, so she just. It was an accident. I was terrified. She was the boss. I thought we were all burning down with the ship. She loved it. She didn't love the bruise on her head, but, yeah, mental sherbet makes sense. You do need a buffer zone between that transition, or people get whiplash, essentially.

Oh, he said that beautifully. Let's end right now.

Call to Action,https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/dangerous-the-fast-track-to-facilitation/lectures/39119292,"Call to action. Go.

You want me to start it? No, I wasn't ready.

No call to action. What do you do to wrap up the workshop? You made it through the day. You've crushed it. You've managed people, you've gotten incredible progress and had some solid ideas. How do you turn that into something tangible so that outside of the workshop things happen? In my case, I'm going to say the standard thing that most people do. You have your list of ideas, you put them up on a whiteboard, then you write out, okay, this person is responsible for this idea or action and it's due on this day. Make it visible, make it big, make it something you can share to everybody. So there's transparency and also there's responsibility. But that's just one way to go about it. And that's kind of the most straightforward way. John, you have some better way, the more complex ways. You have some better, more interactive ways that I want to hear about.

Okay, so there's a bunch, and I'm going to be kind of all over here. One of them is a Google Doc. And you might be thinking, hey, I'm going to do this with a crowd of people that maybe aren't technologically ready for this type of thing, which is a lot of people. Right. If you're in an organization that doesn't allow you to use Google Docs, you've never used it before. It might be complex, right? So it doesn't have to be that. It could be a shared word document or something you pass around, et cetera. The reason you do the Google Doc is you are crowdsourcing the exact information that you want for the after action report or the report that you give them after we're complete and you're getting the group to actually write it for you. And if you know what that report's going to look like just with the blanks in it, you can divide that up, have everybody do it, populate it, and you basically have it ready to turn in immediately after the workshop. Although I recommend waiting a day because it makes it look like you actually put a lot more work into that report than you actually did.

Sweat equity.

Yes. So another thing that you can do is you can do your own report. So you can put a note taker in every group, have those note takers pile back information to you, hold meetings or conferences afterwards where you actually pull that information out. And then you let the best bubble to the surface when you actually give your report. That's another one. Another one that you can do is taking the approach of writing down collect from everybody, what are the things that we are going to accomplish together as a group? And you just write it down really big. This is what you were saying.

There's a whiteboard. We're pointing at a whiteboard.

It's a more nuanced way of how to get it. I pick something and I go, this. Who is responsible for this? And this is somewhat awkward and I don't recommend this for everybody, but if you're in the right group and you have the right wherewithal to do this, you can say, who's responsible for this? And inevitably what you're going to get is crickets. Could be one or two people naming other people or say, I'm not the one that would do that. But that's when you stop and you dig in and you go, okay, listen, we don't need to solve this, but what is the first step in getting to that thing and who's responsible for that? Is it fair to say that we need to set up a meeting to do that or we need to set up a conference call, et cetera, to tackle that? Yes. Okay, cool. Who's going to send out the meeting invite? Okay, Jones. Jones is going to send out the meeting invite. When are you going to have that done? You're going to have it done by noon tomorrow. Noon tomorrow. So everybody here will have something from Jones tomorrow at noon. I write Jones noon. I go to the next thing and I find the very 1st, 1st step in what that action is or what that outcome is for everybody. I make sure it's divided up amongst everybody that's there that can actually help. And then, you know, when you leave that, there are meetings in place, there are action items ready to be taken, you know, going forward. I think there's others, but no, no, no.

I think there's a few themes throughout each of the ones you gave and my solitary example being visibility among all individuals in the group and sometimes throughout the organization so that it is transparent. Two is shared responsibility. So making sure a task is assigned to an individual or potentially a handful of individuals. And then the last one, I had a great point and I don't know where it went, but that's how I feel about that topic. No. So visibility, transparency, and then the last one was such a good point.

Let's pause here. Maybe we can fast forward through this.

Piece until we can fast forward to it.

So just think through it. It's okay. Take your time.

Guys. We took a 20 minutes break. I finally had the thought. I found it. I was walking around, it hit me right in the face. So, visibility, transparency, responsibility by assigning it to people, and then the final one is a concrete step forward that is small enough to get done and big enough to push them in the right direction. And that is how you call your participants to action. And that's how you turn intangible ideas into your reality. Saved it.

I was thinking when you said u turn, I was like, we're getting u turn.

That was good. Back to your reality.

I think we're getting better at ending these videos.

"I survived, now what?",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/dangerous-the-fast-track-to-facilitation/lectures/39119105,"Okay, I'll take it away. Follow up. You've done it. You've completed the workshop.

You survived.

No, it's still time to be serious. Okay. Because we need tangible execution of all the ideas. We need amazingness. So how do we convert what we mentioned in call to action? How do we turn that into something after the workshop, what's the follow up? What's the best way to organize our findings post workshop? And whose belly button do we need to press?

So I think high level. There's a few things that you can do. One is expectation management. What does your host think that they are going to get from you when this whole thing is over? Do they think that they're going to get a rolled up flip chart of all the sticky notes and all the notes that were taken in these discussions that you had? And if so, that's great. You give it to them. Do they expect an email from you that's just a roll up recap of everything? Do they expect a debrief where the following day or week you come back to them and say, this is what we noticed, this is what your people think and this is where we should go moving forward? Do they expect a presentation at the end of your workshop from either yourself or the participants? That expectation management is crucial. So whatever fits the bill best for you before you kind of jump into that, make it work towards you. If you're good with email, make sure you say, I'll be providing you an email and it will include x, Y and Z. Everybody wants to do the under promise, over deliver thing, so manage those expectations right.

I found from experience it's easy to overshoot. If you send a 50 page typed up document that took you 14 hours to do, probably one and a half people will read it because that other person who tried to read it fell asleep before they finished it.

Yes.

So condense as much as possible. You can have all that information available, but it's not necessarily what the person you're giving. You got to think about what they're going to use it for and maybe under delivering that aspect on purpose so that it's simple. I definitely recommend simple email template overview the highlights of the session, maybe one photo where everybody looks good. That's probably not.

They don't even all have to look good.

They don't even know just the person who cares the most.

You have to make sure you look good. The picture that you sent.

So John, you have some specific tools you can touch on them. We'll dive deep later in our other course. Lethal but to touch on the tools for what you use to actually share that information or get that information.

Okay, so one, heard of smart metrics before. If you haven't, you can look it up. There's a lot of information on the line about it smarts. So crafting either that email that you're talking about or a document that everybody has to follow in the breakout groups that you might have in your workshop, sister teams is a really good thing that you can do. Call them sister teams, basically two teams where the success of either depends on the success of both. And so it is in this team's best interest to look out for this team and tell them where they're going wrong, where their transitions are bad, where their the red tape that they're attempting to get around is actually tangible, so that when you pass forward, that result at the end, this is why we're going to do X, Y and Z. It actually makes sense. Sister teams, I like that one. The forms, like a Google forms or something like that, where you can ask very specific, pointed questions from individuals or teams to say, what did you learn? What are we about to do? You know, where are we going to be a week from now, a month from now, six months from now? Whatever that is that you're attempting to accomplish in your workshop, email is pretty much what you're going to probably come down to, whether it's inserting some kind of template or something like that. And to Johnny's point, preparing for that template in advance is crucial because you don't want to finish. You're exhausted. You just did a whole day or two or three, you plan for it. So that's potentially weeks in advance of all that work. You get to the end and you think that you're done. If you actually have a template that you're filling and populating as you go, then you're almost done when the workshop is done. Very minimal effort required after the fact, and it's just going to be cleaner. I'm going to say one more thing. I've been talking a long time. I get it is when you read an email that's three pages long, or you open it, you go, oh, and you close it.

I've heard that.

And you're like, I'm going to read this later. Which never actually comes to fruition, you just don't read it. So it's the difference between sending three sentences and having everybody know every sentence versus three pages where nobody knows anything, and then maybe doing something under the signature line that says, hey, if you really want to dive deep into this and you want to nerd out. Here it is.

100% agree. Have the pictures of everything ready. Have your, I call it a brief, as close to a one page document summarizing the most important stuff. And then if you have interns, have them type up everything, every post and just keep that in the, in the cooker for sure.

And you might actually be offered. This goes back to the expectation management. You might be offered note takers. Do you need anything from me? Yes, I do. I need five note takers. Okay, cool. And then you meet with those note takers in advance. They give you what you need. You compile and crowdsource that information back to them in this email that hopefully is already pre written. Every time I do one, I usually go back to the last workshop I did pull the things that worked really well, and I continuously iterate on my own product as I go to the next thing and the next thing. So do what works for you and you're going to get feedback from the host on what worked and didn't work for them. So you can kind of keep progressing.

Yeah. And because I'm so nice and I always give away templates, I'll give you all my email template and I'll send you an example of what that resultable workshop might look like. It'll be fake. It might be about the Peter with the dog jackets.

Oh, Peter.

We'll see. Yes, we'll see. So that was, what course were we teaching today? Follow up. That was follow up.

I was like, it's okay.

We'll see you in the next section. Do we need to wink out the interview?

Yeah. Left eye.

I have battery.

Let's just roll with it. Okay, hang on. Gopro, turn on. We didn't do this on purpose. GoPro, start recording. There we go. Nailed it.

Pitches: Expanding impact,https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/dangerous-the-fast-track-to-facilitation/lectures/39119345,"We're. This is pitches. La, la, la, la.

So I always start with some. Well, I didn't like that as much, so that was better. How do you get buy in from the other people? No, that's not what we're talking about. How do you pitch the idea? You've got the results of the workshop.

Just keep it going.

You've got the results of the workshop, and now you need to present it to others to get the idea. Well, to grow some legs with it. So, John, when is a case when you would need to actually create a pitch from your workshop? Who's involved in the pitch? Let's start with when.

Sure.

And then we can move to the who.

So, and why when you do it is when you are crunched for time and you need to act as a forcing function to get people to actually do something. Most people don't know how they're going to act or react in a group full of people until they actually do it. So if I know that they're going to have to brief the boss next week, I want to make sure they brief us while we're together so we can help each other improve our pitch. So when they brief the boss, it's ready to go. Another way you would do it is if the boss is actually going to participate in the workshop at the end. And you want to make sure that they iterate enough times before they open their mouth in front of the boss.

Right. So the why behind it and the when are the boss or someone important, someone that maybe wasn't part of the workshop, needs to know the results, and we want to do it in the most effective way possible so that individual will continue to carry on what we decided upon in the workshop. And so how do you organize the pitches? Is there a process? Do you pick? Like, this guy's a superstar, this girl's a superstar. Let's put them on a team. Let's build a wonderful presentation to back them up. And they just.

So you gotta be really careful, right? Because you might have, let's say you have a group of five people and you've got two superstars on this thing.

I know where this is going. Keep going. Two superstars.

Oh, okay. And the other people aren't. Right. They're duds.

They're duds.

You gotta be really careful that you don't allow one person to carry the team because everybody's got a voice. You're hopefully, as a facilitator, attempting to get that silent voice out of everybody. And so the pitch, it will come through that, you're favoring one thing or the other. It's better to iterate and have everybody start with a 10% product. Where you put them on the spot to give a pitch, insta pitch. And then you say, you never spend more time on the feedback of the pitch than the pitch itself. So you say, give me a 15 2nd pitch on what you're talking about right now. They're caught off guard and you say, speak louder. Make sure you include him or her. And make sure you look up super subtle. The next time they give it, it'll be 45 seconds maybe. And they're looking at you, they pass it to the next person and they're speaking clearly. And now you say, okay, and make sure you do this and this. You iterate on that pitch enough times that you get to the end and everybody has been included. You hear everybody's voice and passing on the so what to the boss or the rest of the group of what you're the so what. What you're about to do coming up is conveyed in a succinct and meaningful way as possible.

Sounds simple. So what you're telling me you start off with 15 seconds, get 15 seconds of feedback. So first thought, knee jerk pitch. Then you expand on that and expand on the feedback. And you kind of build until that pitch is maybe like ten minutes long or 15 minutes long.

Depends on how much time you have.

On how much time you have.

But nobody will ever give you a ten minute pitch perfectly. If you say, hey, at the end of the day, you're going to give a ten minute pitch. Start with the butterflies, get them out of the way, and then build on it as you go.

Okay, that sounds relatively easy. So pitch away. Batter up. Other baseball puns?

Yeah.

Time to Celebrate!,https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/dangerous-the-fast-track-to-facilitation/lectures/39119407,"Wacky, waving inflatable arm, flailing tube, man.

We went in sync. I don't know. I was watching us. Incredible. You made it. And we made it.

Yep.

We made it. All of us, we've arrived through this amazing course of dangerous, where we've hoped. You've learned a lot and now feel pretty darn confident. John, what was the intention of this course? What should they have learned?

We hope that you know what you don't know before you know the unknowns. So now, instead of having unknown unknowns, you have at least known unknowns. You know what you need to work on. You know what you need to kind of dive down deeper into, and you have a wherewithal of arriving and accomplishing, planning a workshop to conclusion.

I'm gonna boil it down even more. You know how to run a basic workshop. You know how to facilitate it. You know how to follow it up. And you know now, because we're about to talk about resources, in a second, you'll know where you can learn more. Yes, John, how can they. How should they start off applying this knowledge?

So, sir, small, right? Don't take everything you learned and say to your entire team, hey, we're going to do an entire day off site, and I am now a six degree black belt in facilitation. Please don't do that. Please don't do that. Start small. Do something that lasts 15 minutes. Do one thing to get your presence out there, to understand how you act and react in front of a group of people, and then build on that. Get to the next thing, and to the next thing. Or if you're with a group, take one element of it and string together something that's an hour long with three or four other people, and then build on it, build on it, build on it until you have something that's all your own, that has nothing to do with what we've talked about here, but is unique to your personality, unique New York to your personality.

And if you really like us and our personalities and really like facilitation, come dive deeper with us in this sales pitch. I'm saying right now, only today, at this very moment, if you don't go in the next ten minutes, it might not exist. Check out lethal, where we get a little more than dangerous continuing. So sales pitch is over. If you really did love learning and you want to learn more, you don't have to learn just from us. We've got a list of resources of our own that we like to go to to learn, but also including some of the things we've learned. So a one two punch, it'll be linked somewhere. You'll be able to get to it, whether it's a PDF or a link somewhere on the thing you're watching.

Right there.

So, to wrap us up and to celebrate that you have made it, we're not going to give you a formal graduation, but we are going to have. We spent our whole budget on it. I think it was worth it. We're going to have Paul McCartney sing you out. Come on in, Paul. Paul. So instead of Paul, we stayed within our budget. John, what's within our budget?

This party popper was actually pretty expensive.

It was half a ball.

But we have it now, so let's celebrate.

Hey, Macarena. I'm a ninja. Macarena. I hope we didn't break the audio or your ears. We'll do a warning. This will be very loud and we hope to see you in future courses. Reach out to us. Follow us on Facebook. Become a stale chip. Dippers. Those are our fans. I named them John and come be part of the community.

See you soon.

Facilitator Feedback,https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/dangerous-the-fast-track-to-facilitation/lectures/39119496,"How do you know if you did good? How do you know if you crushed it or if you failed? You've done the workshop, people, you've done it. But how do you continue to get better? Do you just like straight up ask people in the room, like, hey, how'd I do today? Be honest. No, not always. Because they don't want to give you straight up feedback like that. So how do you get feedback so that you can continuously improve?

It has to be anonymous in my opinion, at least. The bad stuff. Nobody really wants to tell you that you are garbage. And so if you are really proactive about asking the right questions, how did I? And I'm not talking about a 25 page form where you have to fill out at the very end of the session something super easy. With enough people, you're going to get the feedback that you need, right?

It could be. You could create your own ten questions. Was the temperature correct? Was the presentation engaging? Was the workshop overall, like, did it help us get further, faster? How'd you get along with everyone else in the room? You can ask some basic questions. You can.

Did I have anything in my teeth? Would not be something that you would ask on that feedback unless you really cared, right?

In my case, what I like to do is find maybe one or two people that during the workshop gave really great feedback overall, like in the workshop, not about me, but about what we were trying to solve and then talk to them one on one and see what they thought about the session and try and like open up and get some honesty out of them. Outside of that, definitely post workshop anonymous survey I think is the best option. Google forms or surveymonkey have easy templates. You could probably even find a facilitator template on there.

My favorite if you are ruthless about getting better, then you ask everybody. There's a plane going overhead.

It's a plan.

You say to everybody, I am ruthless about getting feedback. I want to improve what I did today. I want you to be as candid with me and blunt, as transparent as humanly possible. Can everybody please take out a sticky note and write the worst thing about today and put it in that bucket over there on your way out. And I've done this before where nobody wants to do it and we just say, hey, in order to leave you gotta put something in the bucket. Even if you are doing a fake note that says I'm writing a fake note, you still have to write something and put it in the bucket. And you would be surprised when you get to the end of that. You've asked people for brutal feedback. Someone might come up and say, you read it later. This was phenomenal. I have nothing. I have nothing bad to say, or you mess this up. And here's what you can do to improve. People will be honest with you if you're transparent with them.

Yeah, 100% agree. The only other thing I do sometimes before the workshop, and this is only if it goes well, I do hopes and fears at the beginning of the workshop to understand the expectations of everyone in the room. Hopes being what do they hope to get from the workshop? Fears being what are they kind of afraid is going to happen during the workshop. At the end of the workshop, if it does go well, we can kind of move those over, check them off as we go through them. If the workshop goes horribly, you burn it, you hide it as fast as possible. Do not go through it one by one. Right?

Yeah.

Okay.

Yeah.

So get feedback, because that's the best way to improve. Agree and keep it as simple as possible. That's all you need to know about facilitator feedback.

It's too legit to quit.
