Curious Questions,Medium,"5-7 participants per group, can have multiple groups.",20-35 minutes,"When to use it? Before Creating specific action items (or in tandem).
After; Brainstorming solutions, get more context.  Materials: Post-its & Sharpies for each participant, 1 flip chartper group with Curious Questions previously drawn. What is it? Coming at the topic from the perspective of a child. By that, we mean… asking an annoying number of simple questions to cut the core of our intention. An amazing tool for summarizing the thoughts around a specific topic or an entire workshop itself, the output is the creation of a single source of truth to refer to post-workshop.",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732362/lectures/39187339,"Curious questions, curiosity. It's the wonderful thing that stirs innovation. Thanks, Edgar, for that fun quote. Now, in this exercise, we're going to embody the child in all of us by asking a lot of questions. We've all had someone in the backseat, or been that someone in the backseat asking why, when are we going to be there? How? Who? What questions is what we're going to be asking in this exercise, what you'll need is your group of participants all gathered around one table. Everyone will be given a sharpie, but one individual will be in charge of filling in the chart to my right. They can do it with post its, they can fill it directly on their own. This will help you consolidate all your ideas. Well, hopefully by now you've got one concrete idea, but it'll help you build out that idea so that you're able to describe it to individuals that are not attending this session. Or it's a great sheet for yourself, so that when you revisit what you did in the workshop, you'll actually be able to easily remember, recall what you discussed. So this is called curious questions, or in Spain, it's called mapa de innocencia, the map of innocence. All we're going to do is ask a lot of questions. So starting with what? What is the idea that we're discussing? What is the idea or topic we're discussing? Why? Why is it important? Why does it exist? Why is it valuable? How? How is it going to be used? How do we use it? How do we plan on executing? Who is it for? Who's going to be interacting with it? Where that can be, where are we going to offer this service or product? It can also be, where do we plan to get this work done and when? That's our time schedule. So at the end of this simple exercise, which I know, I say the exercises are simple a lot, because our goal is to make conversations as simple as possible. Your team should have walked through with one single idea. Remember, one idea focused only what it is, why it's valuable, how are we going to execute it? How does it work? Who is it for? Who do we need to get involved with it? Where are we going to execute the idea? Whether that is online, offline, in a digital state? Right?
When? When is it due? So an example of this idea could be we're going to open up or we're going to create the shock socks that was mentioned in a previous episode. Remember, shock socks are little socks that you can walk around in. They give you static electricity so you can shock, maybe your siblings or possibly your best friends in a fun game of sock. Shocking now. So the shock socks, which is difficult for me to say, what are they? I just described them. Why? Well, because it's a fun pastime for individuals and it can be energizing. How? How do the socks work and how do we plan on getting them manufactured? Who, who is it for? Who would be the actual user of this product? And who else do we need to get involved to make this reality? Where, where are we getting it built? Where are we selling it? What are our channels that we hope to distribute it from? And when, when do we hope to get to market? When do we hope to have a prototype of the product? When are we going to schedule our next meeting? So it's a very free flowing series of questions that get you clarity as you go through each step. That is curious questions. And remember the importance of
asking. Ask as many questions as possible to get as much information as possible. This limits us to a flip chart, so we can't get completely overwhelming. A big bonus of it. I like to do this exercise in about ten to 15 minutes with four to five individuals. I like to make it a little more tight knit so that conversations can vary, go deeper, allow for more free flowing ideas. And that is curious questions. Stirring up innovation."
Deeper Meaning,,"5-7 participants per group, can have multiple groups",15-25 minutes,"What is it? It’s all about breaking down to build up. In this exercise,
discover the intention behind the concept. Maybe it is the
function, or maybe it is the values that sparked its
creation. Deeper meaning asks participants to question
""why it even exists?” before building a concept back up

per group.  When to use it? Before:Brainstorming solutions, get more context  After: Identifying the key individuals of focus.",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732362/lectures/39187340 ,"Take a step back and watch as it refocuses in on deeper meaning. What I have next to me is the full, done up deeper meaning. I'm going to give you an example. I'm going to tell you how many participants and how to do it. The materials you need, post its flip chart and sharpies. I like to do this, as always, in groups of five to seven. I've personally ran this exercise with as many as 70 participants, so it's not a problem to have more. It is best to divide them up into little groups so that they can have deeper discussions about the deeper meaning. So I'm going to show you how to set it up, and then I'm going to tell you a story about how I used it. So maybe you can relate and expand on it for your own purposes. So all you have to do is write topic big at the top. Why does it exist today? Right? So why does it exist today means what is the actual deeper meaning? Not just what it does, but the deeper meaning, the values of why it exists today. So the example I like to use is during a workshop which makes engineers, computer engineers with fashion designers. Our goal was to figure out the future of fashion and how to blend technology into actual functionality of fashion. So the first place we started was actually by breaking down. Well, why do clothes even exist? So we put clothes at the top and then we asked ourselves, why do clothes exist today? Now, some of the things that would come up in the conversation were around identity, whether that was social or cultural. I wear my clothes because it is my identity. It represents who I am, it represents the culture I come from or the social environment I am a part of. Maybe it was about function, meaning it was an actual functionality to it, like a swimsuit for swimming, or a fuzzy jacket for warmth, or really light, breathable clothing for fitness. Or it could have been for protection. When we think of shoes or even the jackets we wear, maybe it's to protect us from sunlight. Maybe it's to protect us from, like, police officers wear a bulletproof jacket. Maybe it's to protect us from a variety of situations. So, identity security, function functions, a broad category. So ask them to boil it down a little bit more. What we were able to do with this, and what I like to do when I use this exercise, is to pick a single value. We'll call them values for right now. So if we picked security, that would be our focus for the next step of brainstorming and one of the core values of the final solution we were going to put forward. So when we think about fashion, we think about security. We can find ourselves thinking of various situations. So when you partner a value with a user, then you're able to really effectively create a solution. So I'm going to partner a value with the user. So security, when I think of security and we think of the user of a child near a lake, so how could clothing make them more secure? So a child near a lake, they could get lost. If there's a lake, there's water.
Maybe they don't know how to swim. So I'll focus on that. So maybe we make a swimsuit that upon entering water, the pants actually inflate and provide a life saving jacket, a flotation device that easily keeps the child buoyant and make sure that their parents know that something's happened. So maybe it has a little button in it that goes off too. Whenever
they fall in the water, it alerts the parents on their phones. Now, I'm just brainstorming here off the top of my head. So just by picking a single value of the grander topic of clothes and a user, I was able to generate a very specific idea for a specific scenario that could be completely innovative. Now, you can do this on your own with your group, focusing in on any topic. I like it to be as broad as possible at the beginning. So if you are focusing in on, say, merging technology and fashion, we weren't focused on technology or fashion, we were focused on clothes. So the base level of the whole topic or the area you are focusing on, I like to call this exercise deeper meaning. Some people call it value. Finding the intention behind it is in order to build up ideas, the first thing we should do is break down the existing understanding of the area we are focusing on. So once you get down to that base level, the values of what is an orange for? Right. So what is a fruit provide? Maybe it's just sustenance, maybe it's smell, maybe it's identity. Right. Break it down to the most fundamental definition of it, all the values, and then start building up value by value. You can add in one and another on top of each other as well. So do this. Each group should have their own five to seven individuals in a group. I found this extremely useful at the beginning of any session. Once we're trying to start building up. So the divergent side where we are creating opportunities, creating concepts, when we need a longer list of options. This is a great foundational point that we can come back to and use as inspiration. You may go through security and one user at one point, but then you might focus on identity and another user and continuously generate more and more options until maybe you're overwhelmed and you need to move on to some of the prioritization tips we have in other tools. This is deeper meaning it should take you, depending on the depth of conversation, I'd say 20 to 30 minutes to complete. Any more than that and you're probably stuck in the mud and you'll want to move forward. Prioritize. Pick one of the values. Pick. Take one of your users that you are focusing on for the problem, for the session and go wild. So to continue on some really cool examples of what can come from this, I'm going to go back to the world of fashion in our two and a half, three hour workshop. Here are some of the interesting ideas we were able to create by focusing on a value and focusing on a user. Now, I did ask them to come up with extreme users. So the users were not your everyday run of the mill individual. They were very extreme. So some of the inventions that we came up with in that session were a bra that could help detect breast cancer early on, a jacket to help people on the spectrum of autism to actually communicate their emotions so that doctors could understand them better upon kind of diving into analyzing what might be wrong with them physically or emotionally while they're at the hospital. The next idea, which I thought was pretty cool as well, were sneakers that actually helped, not airplanes.
I dont know if you can hear it, but its pretty loud. But the sneakers themselves were for people that were visually impaired and needed help seeing. The sneakers used some type of sonar technology to bounce off the walls and actually light up the path forward that they needed to go in and gave them some directions as to, hey, youre getting so close to the wall, you might want to stop. Gave them some simple cues that werent out loud so that they didn't feel like they needed to lean on others, that they could do everything on their own. So all the inventions that we created in that two and a half hour session, I got to actually

physically see them built and tested, and they all focus on an extreme user of value that we broke down in the first step of the session and then trying to help an individual improve their lives and empower them in any situation. So never doubt that starting with something simple, breaking it down to the core value won't get you even farther than you could have imagined. Powerful stuff for a simple session. And that's why I call it deeper meaning too. I guess deeper meaning should be serious. So deeper meaning?"
Affinity Mapping,,3-9 participants per group.,10-25 minutes,"What is it? Less of a tool and more of a fundamental process, affinity

This one is to get the crazy into the actionable and tangible by putting things in groups so that you can kind of wrap your mind around what the group is thinking together collectively. Right. I'm going to go through a very simple explanation and then I'm going to kind of dive a little bit deeper into this one.
Okay.
So you're going to come up with a ton of ideas. So we'll call that divergent thought.
Right.
We're going to come up with a ton of stuff. Right. So we've got some horses on here. We've got idea, thought, concepts, green jacket, whatever. It doesn't really matter. Bunch of ideas.
Okay.
You're going to have the very first person come up to the board, create some white space for them. And what they're going to do is they're going to grab an idea that they did not create themselves. So something that wasn't on their post it note or their handwriting, et cetera, randomly grab it. There's no time to sit here and read them all and decide which one they're literally going to grab. One first person is the easiest. They're going to look at it and place it down on the blank side.
Easy.
Second person comes up and imagine you've got a line of people. So they're going quick. Second person comes up, they go, hmm, this one and that one. Are they the same? No. So they put it over here on its own. Here's the thing. They're not talking. They're not saying, is it the same or not? They're having this internal monologue of, is this the same as that? You can play music for this one. I like to play music and I like to speed things up. Go, go, go. Because you'll understand in a little bit that getting through this will be fine tuned as you go forward by other people helping out. Okay, so the third person comes up, internal monologue. Is this the same as that? No. Is it the same as that? No. I'm gonna create another group over here.
Okay.
So it's a third group. Another person comes up, is this the same? Blah, blah, blah. They go, I
think it's the same as that. Now, it's not. Just so, you know, horse and concepts are not the same. Not that you would ever know that, but they're not. So the next person comes up, they look through, they read it, they place it down here, and then they see concepts over here because they're looking at the board and they go, hmm, I think this belongs over here. So yes, they brought one over, but they also moved one, which is okay, next person, next person, next person, so on, so forth, until, you know, all the horses are together, all this stuff, they're grouped in these clusters, in these groups. Right now, let's say somebody moved concepts from here and the person that originally put it there comes back up and sees that their thing was moved. They go, what the heck? Internally, right? Because they're not allowed to talk. Music playing they might grab it and put it back. The thing is, as you go, certain categories haven't been created yet. Certain commonalities and similarities haven't even been done. So they might have a new idea of where that goes, or they might really think it belongs where it was before and they can move it. My rule of thumb is if something has been moved more than twice, so you're about to move it a third, 3rd time, put it at the very, very, very bottom of the board. And this is where we're going to have a discussion about where it goes, when we're allowed to talk. But for right now, everything gets put in magically where it belongs. Maybe there's a couple things down here that we'll discuss.
Okay.
Still at this point in time, you think you're done and maybe you are, you move on into naming. Well, how are you going to name it if you can't talk? Everybody takes out their sticky pad and they write what they think the commonality is of this thing. So I'll give you some examples. Somebody writes, these are all horses and they put it right here, but they're not allowed to talk. So they just wrote it and put it there. And maybe to make it very clear, they circle it. So imagine a ton of ideas going into groups and categories. You circle the different categories so that you can see that they're on their own. And you circle your own title or underline it or something like that. So everybody understands what you named it. Somebody goes, ah, you know, I don't think it should be called these are all horses. I think these are all stallions. They put that over top of what you did. Again, they circle it, underline it, etcetera, until people stop putting titles over other people's titles. If you end up having to rewrite a same title again to put it over somebody else's, grab the entire stack and table it so that you can have a discussion about it. The purpose of this is these are going to get named very, very quickly by everybody. It's going to create some kind of buy in for what it's called where it belongs, et cetera, et cetera, for what you got. So that moving forward, everybody has the same language, etcetera. In my experience, about 92.1% of the time, everything gets racked and stacked the way that it needs to go in the category that it belongs to. There's very few things that are down here, and there are very few titles that have been tabled. You tell everybody in groups, let's call this group of five to seven. You don't really want to do this for a massive group, although I will come back to that, and you can. I'll just explain that in a minute. They'll all be done, they'll all be named, and you'll be able to move on. You tell the groups once you think that you've gotten too far, as far as you can without talking, you can begin to speak. So you're going to start hearing some groups. So say you have 30 people in

your workshop. You're going to have. This group's begun speaking. They started talking. This one hasn't yet because they haven't made it to this point. You should be able to do this entire thing. Five to seven people will say 75 ideas. You can be able to do the entire thing in under five minutes fast, super, super fast. This does not take all day. You're not sitting here reading and moving, reading and moving for everything. You're doing one thing at a time. And as you get moving, the second and third wave, you'll start to understand where they start lying, where the groups start forming, and you'll more easily be able to choose where everything goes. Now, before you start talking, you can tell everybody, okay, we're going to have five minutes of silence for you to pick out things in here, try to move them from the categories that they're in unless they truly belong there.
And you'll find some people might start to create their own, even though you told them no talking and no writing, et cetera. They might draw a line over to a subcategory of these and start putting some stickies down. People will start doing whatever they do, and it'll allow everybody to really understand what's in all these groups and categories beforehand before they have this discussion. Finally, the reason that this is so powerful is, have you ever been in a group before where the boss or the manager or somebody says, we have four pillars of what we do here, and they are x, y, z, elemental, p?
Right?
You got four things. Well, people can't come up with ideas outside of those pillars. You've put a left and right limit on what your mission vision values are by having these four points instead. If you come up with hundred, 200 ideas of what you stand for, what your mission, vision and values are, first you do an affinity diagram of where they belong and you name them. You might find that you don't have four. You might actually have six or five or seven different categories that everything falls into, and it's more fine tuned into what you're trying to achieve. Affinity diagram can be done super quick, and I said I'd actually get back to you about the large group of people doing this. So finally, finally, large group of people can do this. However, doing those finer moves where you have everybody read things and rename them and whatnot, that gets very cumbersome. It takes a lot of time, but doing the grouping itself, I think the most I've ever done is about 300, 400 ideas, 350 on a board. Had a group of about almost 40 people come up to the board. Affinitize it super, super quick. I'd say about six minutes. Six minutes for that group of people. What you're going to find in that case is some of the groups will be doubled up. Somebody will have created a group over here that is almost identical to a group over here, and all you got to do is combine them. That's it.
It's easy.
So this is affinity diagram. There's a lot of different ways to do it. You can potentially talk, you can name them together collectively as a group. You can vote on things as you move on. There's a lot of stuff that you can do moving forward from this point, but this is the start.

Empathy Mapping,,"5-7 participants, as many

more effective. With this series of targeted questions,
groups can inspire their efforts with the needed insights
and perspectives of a specific individual or persona. This
works best if the participants are the persona or have
significant experience with the target persona. Materials: Post-its & Sharpies for each participant, flip charts with

They're still extremely useful. Don't knock it, you might just love it. Now, before you start an empathy map, you are going to need an individual to focus on. I like to use a Persona, just a basic Persona as a precursor. You can just focus on a single individual or user, pick them, focus on them and then walk through the empathy map. You are going to need post its. Everyone is going to need post its. Everyone is going to need sharpies. Again. Five to seven is the best number. Any less than three you are kind of struggling. If you do have the individual who is the user there, it will turn more into an interview. So be wary. Heres how you do it. Now, the setup is pretty simple. Youre going to want to draw this quadrant with a beautiful, somewhat creepy face right in the middle. This will be our user. You can name him, you can label him. If you have or her a Persona already created, simply use that as the basis. You can paste it right in the middle. You're going to want to start with sees and then move to says does. And heres the empathy map is used in order to help us develop a deeper understanding, an empathy kind of a relationship with the individual and their life outside of just the problems we're trying to tackle. But everything they're doing, everything they're thinking, the world they see, it helps us walk a mile in their shoes, as they say. Now, it is simple. It does seem obvious a lot of the time, but common sense can be uncommon and that's where the empathy map is extremely, extremely helpful. So I'm going to walk you through the key questions to ask. Now, a lot of these questions you can find in the empathy map 2.0 from gamestorming. They are incredible. Go to their website. Definitely want to pump them up because it's an excellent resource for any facilitator or workshopper. Now, let's dive into the empathy map. So first you're going to ask the group to take two to three minutes to individually respond to cs, focusing on this user. What do they see from customers, competitors, coworkers? What do they see happening in the industry? Get everyone to write down as many responses as they can to those prompts, only focusing on cs after that. Now, there's two things you can do. You can go through the whole map, but you'll get buried in post its. What I like to do is go through CS and then ask everybody to stand up and come share again.
We try and cluster similar ideas to help us identify common themes or patterns. If you are next level, circle those common themes and patterns and give them a label that helps all your participants be able to recognize from a distance. What are the things that are reoccurring on this, and what are the ideas that we kind of had laid out? Makes it simple from a bit of a distance. So, cs next we move on to SEZ. What does that individual. I like to have them as quotes here. Encourage everybody to write quotes of things they imagine this individual saying, or they've actually heard the user speak them themselves. Again, same process, two to three minutes. Write down as many as possible. Everyone gets up, shares their quotes, grouping similar ones. Moving on to the next. Does. Does is actually the doing the behaviors, the actions that this user is taking throughout the experience we're focusing
on now. We can imagine if it's a customer at a coffee shop, what are they doing? Who are they interacting with? What are the actual physical, mental actions they must take in order to go through the experience, from walking in the door or even getting there to leaving a happy customer? And finally, what we're going to do is hears. Now, here's and says, sometimes people struggle with recognizing the difference. So I like to say, what has this individual heard from friends? What has this individual heard from colleagues? So, as opposed to quoting the user directly, we're going to quote their friends or come up with thoughts that their friends or colleagues might be pointing out to them. It could be shortcomings, it could be positive things. We're just going to try and get everything out on the table using this empathy mat. From there, you've walked in their shoes. You know the user so well, you could probably high five them. It feels like they're right there in the room with you. You can move directly onto the exercise called pain reign, which essentially is writing down all the problems this user is having, trying to get done what they need to get done. Simple, straightforward, immersive. The best thing you can do is have individuals in the room that have experience with that individual. The worst thing you can do is have a group of people that have no context as to what the life of this user is. Just guessing, filling in what that experience might look like. What you're going to get is 100% gut and no data, no real information to inform it. So make sure you have something behind your user. Make sure you know your user well. Make sure everyone in the room understands them, so that when you do this, you can highlight the core issues, the core patterns, and be able to build the best solution possible for that individual. And that is empathy mapping."
Future Focus,,"5-7 participants. For larger groups, subdivide into smaller teams and share insights between teams.",30-40 minutes,"What is it?

",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732362/lectures/39187343,"Future focus. Finding the simplest path forward. By avoiding the good and by bringing in the bad? No, by bringing in the good and avoiding the bad, of course. In this exercise, we do a simple prompt, positive and negative, to help the group identify the moments that we need to focus on moving towards and the bad things that we need to kind of watch out for on our path towards achieving a goal. So, as a preface to this exercise, you are going to need to define a goal as a group. I have that written up here in the top left corner. When you do have that goal defined, it could be a product you're trying to build, a project you're trying to complete. It can be just that broad. In this project, we're trying to build a new database for our entire organization. In this project, we are trying to paint murals all over the city. It can be that broad. It doesn't have to be concrete. Solid. Okay, now, from there, you're going to want to give everybody post its and sharpies, and you're going to want to write it's perfect and it's a disaster somewhere on a whiteboard or a flip chart. Now, individually, you're going to have each participant brainstorm as many thoughts as they can for three minutes around the following. Now, wait. Before we get started, we do want to remember we're in the future. And to help us live in the future, what I like to do is bring all my participants a pair of these super secret high tech glasses. Now, these glasses were made by I can't say whose technology, but a government department's technology with the help of IBM, to help you actually see the future. And there are some options. You can see the ideal future, and you can see the worst future possible. So to do that, what I like to do is actually bust out the glasses, these wonderful guys. Now that everybody has their glasses of the future on, now that we've gotten our selfies out of the way, what I would like us to do is respond individually in three minutes with as many ideas as possible to this first question. In three years time, we've achieved this goal. Every single thing we set out to do has gone perfectly. We are a mega success. I mean, everything we touch has turned to gold. Nothing has gone wrong in this project whatsoever. What I'd like you all to do as participants is, what did we do right in order to get there? At this point, you let everybody brainstorm for three minutes, silently turn on the music, jam out at the end of three minutes, have everybody get up or everybody share their ideas about what did we do right to make everything go perfectly. I've got some examples. Thinking of kind of that building a database for your company. It's just a random example. They said. We did weekly status reports. We had a blended team of people from different departments. We actually solved the correct problem so we didn't get distracted. We knew the scope of the project, and we hired enough people to have the resources to get it done. Based on that, you can also see that those are probably common problems that popped up in past projects.
A lot of p words there. This just highlights where we need to focus our energy to make sure these things are happening to us. These are things we desire. So we got to keep focused throughout the whole project on these little milestones. Now, pause. Let everybody sit back
down, and we're going to brainstorm another scenario. In this case, it's the disaster scenario. In three years time, we did not achieve our goal. Everything fell apart. Literally everything we did was the wrong decision made. We could not have done worse overall on the project. What did we do wrong in order to get in that situation? Give everybody three minutes time to respond individually, come up with as many ideas as possible. One subtle thing I like to do is usually I like to have maybe a blue or green at the top and a pink or an orange at the bottom. The color difference really helps when you're sitting a bit farther away to recognize the good and the bad. And it also has some little triggers mentally that go along with it. So after everybody stands up and individually shares again, what we're going to do is look at the ideas. It's great to be able to cluster similar ideas. Those are kind of bigger fears that we have about this particular project. The great thing about beginning in the future and looking backwards is it really helps provide a clarity of the description and the ideas that are put up on the board. So here's some of the examples of why the disaster happens. We had too many other projects, and we actually couldn't focus our effort on this specific project. That can lead to a whole nother conversation about diving into what are the priorities of our organization. Bad design. We actually didn't put a focus on making it easy to use or what we created didn't even solve the problem at all. Maybe we did no research. So the problem we tried to solve didn't exactly solve the problem at hands, or we operated in silos isolated from one another. So that lack of communication created a lack of efficiency, which made us just not get to the due date on time. These are all various scenarios that could be applied to the example I started with, or to maybe the situation you find yourself in now. I love to do this at the beginning of any project. It's a great tool for aligning your team on a single goal, but also on the milestones that we want to focus on, the things that we want to drive towards, and also the scary, hairy things that we want to avoid. We don't want any monsters in our closet. It's best that we can see them out in the light. In this exercise, you can complete the whole process within 40 minutes, depending on how deep of a discussion you go to. As always, I recommend five to seven participants per group. If you do have more than that, you can divide up, but you will have to do a playback or a pause to share what each group has uncovered. Now, I like to do that time boxing the individual sharing to a minute, a minute and a half to share what their insights were to the other group or a story time, and then allow everyone to have the full context so that when they go back to their groups, maybe they have an internal discussion and maybe that cross contamination helps provide a better result. So this was future focus. And I know the glasses are silly, but they are intentional because it creates a great environment for sharing openly amongst participants. So go the extra mile, go to dollar tree, get some glasses.
But whatever you do, make sure you use this tool at the beginning of your project. Don't wait until it's too late. Future focus."
I Like I Wish,Easy,"5-7 participants per group are the

they are in a trusting environment and are unable to

Here you're at a standstill. You don't have people that are willing to speak up and speak out and actually get their voice heard or they don't feel like they're in a trusting environment or fill in the gaps. I like, I wish, I recommend. I like, I wish, I recommend really, really good tools to bring this out of everybody, especially if you force everybody to come up with one of each. So consider yourself in a group of five people. You could bring out something like this to say, I would like you at the end of x, y or z to give. I like, I wish, I recommend feedback to Johnny or to Susan or to Carol. And at the end, everybody's going to give all three of these. I like how you spoke very loud and clear. I could understand what you were saying. I wish that you had a better transition between this and that. I recommend the next time that you do this, you figure out what to do with your hands because you're all over the map over here, right? You go to the next person, the next person, so on and so forth. And this constructive feedback is made better by giving something that's positive. I like. Right. I wish is a better way of saying you suck and you should do this next time. I wish is more of like a. I wish you did this in the next, the next round, etcetera. And then I recommend is another soft way of putting it. These are three ways that I have found beneficial across the board for feedback in small groups, in large groups, to get discussions going with a. A massive group to say, what do we think about our organization? I like this. I wish we did that. And I recommend in the future we do this. And it's just something that if everybody kind of writes down really quick, you give everybody, I'd say no more than 90 seconds, no less than 45 seconds. Somewhere in that realm is very quick to go around the room. 45 seconds go. They come up with them and then you go, what did you say? What did you say? And you kind of pull it out. Or you have everybody go back to back to back all the way around, read what they have on their piece of paper or their sticky etcetera. I like, I wish, I recommend, I like, I wish, I recommend."
Moodboard,,"4-6 participants per group,
unlimited groups.",30-40 minutes,"What is it? Feeling a little moody? Pulled from the world of fashion,
this tool helps uncover solutions by stealing inspiration
from competitors in our own industry or leaders in other
industries. Don’t always reinvent the wheel. Slap some
fresh wheels on and speed towards innovation! Materials: Post-its & Sharpie for each participant, smartphone or laptop, flip chart or wall space for placing ideas, magazines, or printed images. When to use it? Before: A full brainstorming session. After: Identifying the key problem.",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732362/lectures/39187345,"Feeling a little moody. Me too. In this simple exercise, we're going to talk about mood boards. Now, it is pulled from the fashion world, so if you have a background in fashion and design, you'll probably be familiar with this process. In order to complete it in the most fun way, in my opinion, you're going to need a printer, possibly a stack of magazines. Five participants, four would be okay. Five per group is what I find to be best practice and a simple problem to be solved. Now, once you have your problem written out that you're going to try and tackle basic, straightforward, you're going to ask the group to get on their computers and find solutions that exist in the world to that particular problem and print them off. Now, let's make this a little more concrete. So say you're trying to build a new company website, sit down with the group and encourage everybody to go online and find from the competitors what they have to offer. Now, that doesn't necessarily mean that we're going to steal like an artist and take all their ideas, but we are going to get a broad landscape of what others have already thought of. So in this particular scenario, we'd get everyone to go online. After we generate a big list of the competitors or people that we aspire to be like, that inspire us, we print off what their home website would look like, what their options for services contact us, even. What's the fun videos they have laid out. We print all that out and put them all on one single wall together. Now, as we go placing them on the wall, we're going to start. Instead of keeping the images in groups according to where they came from, we're going to group them according to similarities between the broader number of photos. So at the end of the day, what we're going to have is a grouping of patterns that we find among our competitors, among the people we aspire to be like. We can recognize those general themes as maybe points that we can touch on and put in our own flavor. So a mood board is just a simple process of grouping together images to identify patterns. Although your intention at the beginning is to get as many images as possible, in the end, you're going to focus on a few core patterns. In the world of fashion, what they might do is go out. Let's say we're looking at Ralph Lauren, Polo. We're going to look at all their competitors, like Brooks brothers, like Izad. I don't wear those type of clothes, so I'm just throwing those out. Now you're gonna look at their competitors get every single image they have on their website out. And then at the end of the day, you might have a thousand different photos which you begin grouping according to the cut of the shirt, the color of the shirt, the actual model, and what they look like. Are they trying to offer to younger individuals that have younger models or older or broad shouldered, stronger models or thinner? Or also look at the backgrounds of where the models are, and you can tie everything into, identify core themes, core patterns, and then build upon them. That doesn't mean you have to include what you're selling or what the solution you're trying to build. You don't have to include every single point, but they do serve as incredible northern lights, being able to recognize those commonalities between everything. And that's what the mood board is about. One visual location. It's very key. One location where you can see everything, the whole
environment of the industry or the whole environment of the solution that we're trying to solve. Simple, as always, straightforward. Keep your groups to five people per group and try and give them at least an hour. This is a deep dive into pulling information. An hour to pull information. 20 to 30 minutes.
Actually group it and discuss it. What you get after, you can create a simple after action report. You can highlight the themes. You can draw the values, the core values, the core colors, the core features of whatever you found, and one up them in your own product. And that is how we use a mood board to get a little more moody."
Persona Please,,5-7 participants per group.,20-45 minutes,"What is it? While each human is different, we tend to follow certain patterns. By using the persona tool, our group can dive
deeper into the mindset, experiences, and opportunities of key individuals, helping us to get further faster. Materials: Persona Please template (1 per group). Post-its
& Sharpies for each participant.  Persona Please template can be found at this url link: https://www.stalechips.com/_files/ugd/46f139_822a3c6c91464565bde0d4497213c956.pdf ",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732362/lectures/39187365,"As featured in the world famous web series for facilitators online in obscure corners of the Internet. Don't take it personally. Highlighted this simple exercise, and this is about doing it your own way. This exercise should be used at the beginning of any project or discussion that you are trying to build into a brainstorming session or ideation session. It's all about focusing on an individual and you will need data to back it up. While you can go with your gut, it's better to actually go with stats and real information so that you don't trip on assumptions, which can be a common thing that designers or solution makers or change creators can do. So here's what you need. A flip chart. Five to seven individuals. You can do this with more, but five to seven individuals per flip chart. You're also going to need post its. Everyone's going to need post its and sharpies and about 20 to 25 minutes depending on the depth you'd like to get from the exercise. It can be done in ten to 15 minutes very easily. If you put people under pressure, it can be done even faster. But if you're trying to base it on facts and not fiction, I recommend giving them a little more time. So the Persona is used at the beginning because we're going to focus on a single individual that is our ideal consumer of whatever we are pitching. That could be a product, an idea. It could be the person who's suffering the problem we're hoping to solve. So thinking of that Persona, that first person in line that we're trying to help, the one really, really frustrated with whatever problem we've run into or whatever context, we're going to start with this individual and we're going to build from there. The Persona has a handful of parts. You're going to add a name and a drawing. I don't have a drawing. Here. You're going to list out some of their common behaviors, demographics, about their backgrounds, and some of the needs and goals they have. Again, this will be kind of like your mascot. So the team will all have a common person that they can say, well, would Phil actually like that part of the idea? Would that actually help Phil with his problem? So I'm going to dive in fully to the example. So the idea we have behind this is Phil. Phil is a college student. As you can see, he's from Virginia beach. He's single, he's a sophomore, he's 20 years old. He's a part time dog walker. Now, Phil, his behaviors. He eats a peanut butter and jelly sandwich every single day of the week. He loves them ever since he was a kid, and he oftentimes has to use the change in his car to get his groceries. So we know he's tight on money. We know for some reason he really loves peanut butter sandwiches. We know he's a college student, so we can already kind of paint the picture. The deeper in detail you dive on the Persona, the better it is for the entire team.
By painting it as real as possible, our ideas and our perspective will be enhanced. We will kind of embody the role of Phil as we are creating our ideas. It narrows this down at the very beginning so that from there we can expand onto ideas that are from that individual's perspective, as opposed to just throwing out ideas and then trying to glue one to the needs of Phil. We're actually starting with the needs of Phil and then building the ideas from there. So needs and goals. You can see he doesn't want to be homesick at all, which is why he eats
peanut butter jelly sandwiches, because they remind him of home. He needs to get the most out of his money, and he really wants to have enough money to go to all you, you can eat wing night on Thursday. Thursday. So this is a simple Persona. Let's figure out how we can actually apply this into our own activities. So if you're on a sales team and you're trying to identify the common customer types that you run into, so that a new sales individual, when they're onboarding, can simply read through the different Personas and then actually know how to handle the different objections, the common pain points, and actually be functional as fast as possible. Now, if you are creating a marketing campaign, you can use the Persona to highlight the individual that is most commonly going to use your product, so that the team can brainstorm ideas that would attract that customer as easily as possible. Now, if you are just a facilitator managing workshops, you can use Personas in order to effectively know who's going to show up in the room. In our series, don't take it personally. We dive into all the different Personas you may run into. You can make it your own, make it your way. I personally have used it for a variety of situations. I like it at the beginning of the workshop so that we are all aligned on who is the person that is suffering the most from this problem at hands. And then from there, we can ideate ways of how can we help them, how can we improve their daily life? And that's Persona. Simple exercise, quick and easy, can be done depending on how much pressure you put in ten to 15 minutes. If you really want to deep dive, give the group 20 to 25 minutes to share and discuss."
Mario v Wario,,3-7 participants per group.,30-50 minutes,"What is it? Classics from the Nintendo game “Super Mario”, this tool builds upon Persona Please. Using two personas, we widen our scope of focus to uncover a greater depth of context and understanding around a given problem. Materials: Persona Please template (1 per group), Post-its & Sharpies for each participant. Persona Please template can be found at this url link: https://www.stalechips.com/_files/ugd/46f139_822a3c6c91464565bde0d4497213c956.pdf ",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732362/lectures/39187367,"Mario, Wario. Two classics of the Nintendo game, mario who were enemies against each other. In this process, we're actually going to have two different Personas. So remember, Phil, if you haven't watched the Persona exercise yet, dive into that one first, because this one will build upon it. The Persona. Right. It helps us identify our target user. In this case, we're going to identify two different users. We're going to identify the first in line to use this idea or the first person that this will be most helpful to. And then second, we're going to do the person who's on the fence about using this idea. So Mario will be our first in line, and Wario will be the one on the fence that we probably have to do a little more convincing to actually bring out to use our product. So here's why we do that, and here's what you need. You need two teams. Now, teams just need more than three people. We like to put a ceiling at seven. So three to seven people per team. Assign one to be a wario, the person on the fence, and one to be a Mario, and then allow them to define their Persona based on whether or not that's the ideal customer or a customer that we're trying to bring over to our side. Right. Great examples of that could be the ideal customer for a chocolate chip cookie. I love using chocolate chip cookies as my example, so maybe I would be the ideal customer. I like to eat chocolate chip cookies every night after dinner. They remind me of home. They remind me of my mom and her cooking. So they could target me, an individual who is somewhat healthy, somewhat healthy food conscious, but willing to separate from my diet for a little wholesome goodness once or I say once a week. That's a lie. Maybe three times a week. It could be an extreme user, even more than me, someone who eats cookies every single day. Maybe that's not as healthy. Or it could be someone who's on the fence. When we think of someone who is very health conscious, who might cheat from their diet once a month, who cannot eat gluten, who only eats sugar free in their diet, how would we offer our product to them? How would we offer our cookie idea to them? And do we need to change some of the things in our product in order to get them on our side? We can also do that without changing our own product. We can just change the way we offer it to the client as well. So maybe we just try and get in the cycle of when their cheat day is. Or we hype up the fact that they have this cheat day, and if they want it to be the best one ever, this is what they do. So that's the Wario Mario type game again. You set it up in two different groups. You let them go through the full exercise of a Persona, followed by an empathy map, followed by brainstorming the potential ways we can draw them in, or the potential ways we can enhance or alter our initial idea to fit their needs a lot better. At the end of the day, you walk away with incredible perspectives from both where we normally would go, our target market, and someone who needs a little bit of help to get on our side.
You share with the two groups. I love to make it a prototype where they actually physically build an experience, whether it's with Legos and play Doh or cardboard. But walk through the experience and tell us the story of what that Wario individual's experience would be like
with our offering or idea versus the Mario. Simply done. It should take, if you go through the Personas and the empathy map, plus a brainstorming, about an hour and 20 minutes. But that's an entire workshop. If you just want to identify the Wario and the Mario, that whole process can take ten to 15 minutes per group, plus about five to seven minutes of sharing back. So for the exercise, you will need post its sharpies, two flip charts, and two Persona grids already prepared, drawn out, not filled in, and that is Mario versus Wario."
Rapid Research,,"5-7 participants per group, unlimited groups.",20-30 minutes,"What is it? While most exercises focus on using a human’s natural
computer, the brain, this tool allows participants to use
the power of the mighty SMART PHONE (or laptop) to
search for inspiration from existing solutions. Thinking of
the problem at hand, participants will be asked to
uncover incredible opportunities that companies have
already attempted before putting a custom spin of their
own. Materials: Post-its & Sharpie for each participant,
smartphone or laptop, flip chart or wall space for
placing ideas. When to use it? Before: A full brainstorming session. After: Identifying the key problem",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732362/lectures/39187370,"Rapid research, you've already identified the problem and now you're desperately in the hunt for solutions, an exciting place to be. Now, in most of the workshops you might discourage individuals from having their cell phones or laptops out. In this particular exercise, we want everyone to have their cell phone, their laptop, whatever source they can have to get information off the Internet so they can pick and choose the greatest ideas that exist already, that people have already tried, that people have already put out there today. Now with rapid research, what we really need is each individual to have a stack of post its, each individual to have their sharpie, and then of course a space to put all the ideas. Now each individual will hold onto all their ideas until the 15 minutes of rapid research is up. They can also write on white a one paper. But I like to have post its because they're colorful and they're smaller, so the ideas aren't as overwhelming or an individual isn't tempted to write as much. So here's how you do it. You take a single problem, a concrete problem. So say you're working in sales. Maybe you're trying to figure out the tiers of gifts you give to prospects or potential clients. That can be a difficult one. Or maybe your company that has a car lot that actually has indoor cars. You can't find them when someone moves them because gps won't work inside. Now you have to figure out how can you track an object indoors at scale, at an affordable price. Pretty overwhelming problems compared to just buying gifts. What you can do with your group, you have the problem identified. You ask each individual to silently bust out their cell phone thinking of the problem. Try and find other examples of what people have used to solve that particular problem. So when we think of tiered gifts for sales, maybe what we're offering has a clever name. So we're going to look up ways to give gifts that make reference to that name. Maybe Coca Cola has done a really cool consumer facing gift project. Maybe we can personalize every individual gift and maybe someone is out there already doing it. Now, what you do as the facilitator is simple. Just say you have 15 minutes to go out and find the most amazing examples of solutions to this problem that exists in the world today. Allow them to use their cell phone and their laptop. Try and encourage them to find as many as possible. And then afterwards, we're going to have a presentation session, a sharing session. In story time, we're going to let all the individuals, which means if this has more than ten participants, they'll just pick one idea if you have less than ten. I found it is reasonable for individuals to share two of their best ideas or findings from their rapid research with the entire group in about a minute and a half to two minutes. So for this entire exercise, it may take 30 minutes. That's 15 minutes of research and 15 minutes of sharing. You have to keep everybody on track and on time. A key piece of this whole exercise is that during the sharing session, every individual will have a note pad or simply a one paper on hands. Well, they'll take notes about some of the ideas they really liked and why they liked them. Now, at the end of this, we're not going to vote on any ideas that have come out of it. This is just informational. This is to kind of enhance the next step, which will be a brainstorming session where we can pull some of the ideas we
found and tailor fit them to what we are trying to accomplish. Maybe we want to integrate some of our solutions a little bit more. Maybe we want to integrate some of our flavor personality a little bit more.
But we're going to take a concept and reverse it onto something we actually are trying to solve again. Cell phones, laptops, get out there, dig, find information. While this does seem like an incredibly simple exercise, everyone researches different, everybody types in different keywords, so everybody will bring different results to the table. And that combination of ideas and insights is going to add an incredible, I always say, incredible, inspirational, groundbreaking amount of ideas in the follow up. So this is just before an actual deep dive brainstorming session. Informational. But the output from the brainstorming session is about tenfold in quality because of this simple 30 minutes effort. Rapid research. It's like magic."
Stacks on Stacks,,"5-7 participants, but can be adapted for larger groups by subdividing into smaller teams.",12-20 minutes,"What is it? ""Stacks on Stacks"" is your go-to exercise for organizing and prioritizing ideas quickly and effectively. Think of it as building a tower of creativity, where each idea adds a new layer. Participants silently write down their thoughts on Post-it notes and stack them on a board. This method is perfect for ensuring that all voices are heard and for identifying the most promising ideas through a structured yet flexible process. Materials: Post-it notes and Sharpies for each participant, a board or wall space with lines for organizing ideas. When to use it? Ideal for teams needing to generate and prioritize a large number of ideas quickly, especially in the early stages of project planning or strategy sessions.",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732362/lectures/39187374,"Stacks on stacks. In this one, you probably don't want more than five to seven people. You can do it with less. Certainly you can definitely do it with more. It's just going to add a lot more time to this. You could do it with a group of 30 people, but, I mean, it's going to take up probably more time than it's. Than it's worth. So I would recommend subdividing those up into, you know, groups of six or seven people. Public math, whatever that comes to. Okay. What you need for this one is a bunch of post it notes for everybody. Everybody gets their own and a sharpie, and then preferably a board. And this can be on a wall. You can use tape to do the lines like I've drawn here. You can put it on a board and draw them out yourself. It's really up to you. This is what you're going to get everybody to do. Everyone is there for some kind of common purpose. So it's mission, vision, value, strategy, etcetera. Right. How might we fill the blank? Well, for this one, you're going to ask everybody to come up with four answers or solutions or thoughts revolved around that one question. Okay. And have them write it without talking about it. So it's silent. Maybe play a little bit of Enya, because everybody loves Enya, if it's true. And give them some time. I would give them at least four minutes. And stress the importance of how specific or detailed oriented you want to go into a specific topic. Okay. You can do more than four ideas, but no less. So everybody has a minimum four ideas. You get everybody to do it. They are now around a board like this. This is what you're going to get them to do. So imagine there's five people. They're kind of in a school circle around this board. And now you're going to get the first person to read the very first one. If anybody else has one, they're going to kind of clump it together. So this is like a moving affinity diagram, but it's not really shown in that sense.
Okay, so cool, somebody else has one. Instead of going in order, allow that person to speak as well because it might be a different type of idea. So whatever this idea is. Okay, cool. I've got something similar. They read it. Cool. Put it down together, move to the next one. The next one? The next one. You go all the way around, then you tell everybody. Okay, you can only take one of your idea to put it in the top. One of your ideas down here, one at the very bottom. And then you have to throw one of them away, like, what's your worst idea that you came up with? Like, discard it? Because at this point you will have heard from everybody else. You put your three up there. So this is what's going to end up happening. You're going to end up having, you know, somebody will have one there, here and here, here and here. And finally here, here and here. Okay, cool. So again, three people. It's not five, just an example. Now you have the discussion. You vote on the best ones of these, or you look for common patterns, right? So say this one and this one are like that. But this idea is better. Let's move these down here. Okay, maybe this one and that one are very similar to that one. So you're going to put these down here. You're going to rack and stack this so that only one out of all five of you, right? So five of you came up with four ideas each. Public math 20. There's 20 ideas. You're only going to let one come to the top. You're going to allow two to
land here in the middle, and you're going to allow three to land at the bottom. So in the end, it'll look something like that. The very best idea at the top, two, and then three at the bottom. Now, from here, depending on how you rack and stack this, they would be kind of vertical. I've done it horizontally, but you'd have them kind of in a vertical fashion like this.
And then you would create columns off to the right. Those columns could be the who, what, when, why, how, where, what kind of resources do we need? Where are we going to run into trouble? What's the duration? When should we start? Like all those questions that you would want to get, get at, or plus up from. And now you're going to write them as you go. I have found that in a group of five people, you can divide and conquer this so quickly. You can say, okay, Johnny, you're going to do all the durations. Susan, you're going to do all of the who's. Who is the belly button that we need to press to move forward? Who is the this, who is the that, etcetera. You're going to do this, you're going to do that, and you divide and conquer and you fill out this whole chart. So now you've got, arguably, prioritized without really having the discussion in depth about priorities. You have the single best idea, maybe call that the now you have the next two ideas, maybe that's the soon. And then you have the last three, which could be like the later our future development plan. So eight great ideas, and then you have all of the solution sets, the who, what, where, when, why, how behind them, so that you can reflect on this. Now, assume you have 30 people in a group. Everybody has done this. Now you get to share out those ideas as a whole with a group. Are there any other groups that independently came up with the same idea? I like to say that's incredible. That's great. Some people think that's not a very good use of everybody's time if everyone's kind of coming up with the same solutions, but you're validating that it was in fact a great idea. What if they're different? I say that's great, because now you get to see that these people independently came up with the ideas themselves. Then they got together with four other people and put them on a board like this. Then those groups got together as a whole. And so having different ideas is great. You're fleshing out these independent thoughts from individual to small teams to whole groups and teams. It's a really good method to do it. You can tweak this so many different ways. I actually wrestled with teaching this in like three or four different formats, but I ultimately settled on one that's generic, so that you can kind of make this exactly what you need to do for your own style and outcome that you're looking to achieve. So for a group of five people, this should not take from start to finish teaching everybody what to do and racking and stacking. It shouldn't take more than about nine minutes. If you're getting in the realm of 1520 minutes, then this has not solved the purpose of efficiency and effectiveness for you. And you need to potentially try something different or speed them up any less and you kind of risk not providing the quality answers that you need from the group. So kind of tweak it as you need, as you see fit. And there you go."
Stakeholder Map,,5-7 participants per group,20-45 minutes,"What is it? A quick process for visualizing the entire environment
surrounding a given topic, situation, or task. It helps us
identify misaligned pieces of the bigger picture and
uncover unique opportunities to improve. Materials: Post-its & Sharpies for each individual, Large Flip Chart, or Wall Space. When to use it? Before:Diving into solving a problem.  After: Identifying the issue or prioritizing a key issue to tackle",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732362/lectures/39187375,"The ultimate step one in problem finding is knowing who's having the problem. That's when the stakeholder map is the perfect tool to use. Now, to do the stakeholder map, all you need is a group of participants. Again, I like five to seven as the sweet spot, a flip chart post its. Each individual will need their own post its. And of course, sharpies. Everyone will need sharpies. In fact, I need one right now. What you're going to have everyone do is simply write down all the individuals involved in the scenario we are looking at. For today's purposes, I'm looking at a coffee shop and the individuals involved in the process of going through a coffee shop. When we think of our customers, right? So who all is involved in a coffee shop? Who are the players? We call them stakeholders. We know there's different employees. And when we expand even farther from barista or cashier, we know that someone has to be baking, someone has to be making the goods. Farmers have to be supplying the coffee beans, they have to supply the flours and materials. The flour and materials to make baked goods. There may be a factory involved for the cups. There could be an app where you order online, and someone has to make that. And behind all of that, there's also an owner of the coffee shop that may not be an employee on the field. And when we think of customers, there's just a lot going on. Right. And to put order to that chaos is what this exercise is for. So allow everybody five minutes to put up everyone they can think of that's involved in the process of this coffee shop. We can go as deep as the farmer and the coffee bean. We can go even deeper if we have to, but I think this is about the right level. So we're going to focus on now figuring out how these stakeholders interact. It's great to have a list of people that are involved in the experience we're focusing on. It's even better to understand how they interact so that we can identify some core moments that are causing friction hurdles or problems altogether. So to do that, we have a simple, not high tech method. We're going to draw a line from one individual, one stakeholder to another. Now, that line can only go in one direction. That's so this doesn't get confusing. And our second rule is that every line must also have a description of the interaction. So we can imagine the cashier is going to pass on the order information to the barista. That's pretty simple. Well, maybe the barista is going to give them the coffee, right? That's pretty simple. Now we know the customer will probably go through the drive thru and ask the cashier.
That will be passed to the barista. Well, the barista might need to talk with the baker. The baker will maybe give suggestions of flavors. We'll say that we'll also have a delivery person who interacts with the baker, who interacts with the owner. The farmer and the baker could interact. The farmer and the owner could interact. Regardless, you can see the layers of complexity that you will find. An interesting thing that I'd like to highlight. Remember, arrows can only go one direction. Every single arrow drawn should have a description of that interaction. So the delivery person, what are they doing with the owner? The owner, what are they doing with the farmer of the coffee beans? At the end of the day, what you're
going to have is an in depth view of how all the different pieces and parts interact with one another. And from here, you can dive even deeper to highlight. You can give all the participants a handful of red dots and ask them to place the red dots on the interaction that causes the most friction throughout the entire experience. This exercise can take up to an hour. I prefer to try and keep it within 30 to 35 minutes of deep discussion around who are the individuals involved, the stakeholders in this experience? How do they interact? Try and get every interaction possible. And then what are the core moments of frustration? From there, we can pull out those frustrating moments and start brainstorming on solutions on opportunities to improve the overall experience. You may find that they get caught up in details and get caught up in depth. If you find people going too deep, such as the customer types we know at our coffee shop. There's a lot of remote workers at our coffee shop. We're near a school, so a lot of kids come in after school because we have this awesome vanilla frappe thing that's super delicious. That's kind of like a milkshake, right? So understand the different customers to a degree. Don't dive completely into their Personas and knowing everything about them. Maybe you'll find yourself getting caught in the weeds of the delivery driver who hired the delivery driver and such. If that is helpful to the conversation, allow it to go deeper. If it is distracting and focusing in on something that actually doesn't impact our situation and the problem we're trying to solve, then we can table that and say, let's try and focus our energy on more important matters at this moment. Okay, so this is stakeholder mapping. This is your snapshot, your view into the world, the environment of all of our stakeholders and should give you and your group a deep understanding of the problem at hand and possibly highlight that problem enough to where you can directly move on to brainstorming or need to dive deeper with some more research."
Surroundings Survey,,"Unlimited, but make sure the number of flip charts corresponds
to the number of attendees.",10-15 minutes,"What is it?  Before the workshop even begins, partner with key
stakeholders to develop a list of powerful questions the
group needs to discuss. An informal, formal icebreaker is
a meaningful method for moving the ball forward. No
rules and no time wasted. Just action! Materials: Flip charts, list of agreed-upon questions, Post-its & Sharpies for each participant. When to use it? Before: Diving into a session. After: Kicking off a session.",https://stalechips.teachable.com/courses/1732362/lectures/39187383,"Surroundings survey. This is where you pulse the audience in some way, shape or form before you arrive. This can be done in a ton of different ways. One, you could get the host or the person bringing you on board, the boss or it doesn't matter to answer a bunch of questions that you have and you could send them in an email, you could call them and you're having them give you insights into the organization or the team or individuals, et cetera. You could send out a survey to them to populate out to the masses, et cetera. In the end, all you're looking to get is a couple really good problems or ideas that you can then put on a piece of paper and put around in numerous stations, around a room or on a desk or in index cards or on the very first sticky note that you pass out to every single person. Right. The purpose of this, obviously a little bit of prep work to get you there. The purpose of this is to save a lot of time. When everybody comes in. It can be kind of like an icebreaker. At the same time, it is very meaningful to kind of move the ball forward, right. So instead of me giving a bunch of rules and regulations and things that you got to do for me to get X, Y and Z and then pass it out and waste a lot of time, I can do that before everybody gets here. Pass it around, put it in modules. My favorite thing to do is to put a flip chart in numerous stations around the room. And I try to get the number of flip charts to correspond to the number of people that are coming. If there's 30 people coming, I like to have at least seven to ten flip charts so that it's not too crowded. I try to do more. 15. It's a lot, I know, but at that point you're only going to have two people at any given flip chart, which I think is a good number to have. Any more than that, it gets crazy. Any less than that, you're kind of on your own. You can do this. A one, v one. So if you have ten people, you put up ten boards and you use it to say, okay, for the amount of time from here to there, two minutes, we're going to focus on your station. When I say go, you're going to spend those two minutes. When I say stop, you're going to turn to your right and everybody's going to rotate around clockwise or counterclockwise, whatever you want to do. Or you just allow chaos to take place and you say go and write on as many as possible. The one at the end with the most places that they visited wins and everybody's competitive, or a lot of people are, they're going to run around the room and put as much stuff all over the place as they can and they're either going to plus up these ideas or put their own, or they're going to kind of dive a little bit deeper on the root cause or the smart metrics that are following it, et cetera. So you can have it so that they write it out actually, or on post it notes where they go and put it on there. It's completely up to you. Again, the purpose of this one is to get it in advance so that when they show up, you hit the ground running. It's a really good way to divide the group so everybody gets their blood flowing before you start. That's why I called it an icebreaker in the beginning. If you do make it a competition, people are going to be moving really, really fast and that's going to kind of wake everybody up. You could do something like this after lunch, which sounds a little bit counterintuitive, but they'll be a little bit sluggish here and there. But when they move, and you could say the ground is lava and there's a whole bunch of games that you can
play to get everybody to move faster. You can move them through on time boxing. Hey, you only have 30 seconds. Go, go, go.
It's completely up to you. But this one is surroundings survey."
